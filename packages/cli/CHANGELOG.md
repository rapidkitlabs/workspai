and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.48.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Added a governed Workspace Intelligence evaluation workflow with
  `workspace eval init`, `record`, `status`, `report`, and `compare` for
  measuring retrieval payloads and model-usage observations without making
  unsupported universal token-saving claims.
- Added portable Knowledge Graph exports for JSON-LD, GraphML, and GEXF, plus
  typed entity, evidence, path, search, benchmark, and change-overlay surfaces.
- Added versioned evaluation, evaluation-comparison, and model-usage-event
  contracts and registered their artifacts for CLI, CI, IDE, MCP, and agent
  consumers.
- Added a documentation content contract and stronger drift guards covering
  Graph commands, Evaluation artifacts, runtime selectors, source-of-truth
  boundaries, examples, and README command smoke tests.

### Changed

- Expanded the machine-readable Workspace Intelligence architecture and
  runtime command-surface contracts so Graph and Evaluation capabilities are
  discoverable from the same contract inventory used by the CLI.
- Clarified that the Workspace Model is the system source of truth, while the
  evidence-backed Knowledge Graph is a deterministic, model-bound derived
  representation with multiple portable projections.
- Reworked the root and CLI READMEs around user goals, the canonical lifecycle,
  generated evidence, consumer paths, and verifiable claim boundaries.
- Expanded the `wspai` alias README with installation guidance, delegation
  semantics, canonical state behavior, and direct documentation links.
- Bumped the monorepo root, `workspai`, and `wspai` packages to `0.48.0`, and
  aligned the alias dependency on `workspai@0.48.0`.

### Fixed

- Fixed CLI validation for the documented Graph options:
  - `workspace graph search --limit`
  - `workspace graph overlay --from`
- Fixed architecture-contract drift that omitted current Graph query/export
  commands and the complete Evaluation capability and artifact inventory.
- Removed stale documentation language that described the current graph as a
  dependency-only or JavaScript/TypeScript-only view.

### Verification

- Full CLI suite: 2,071 tests passed across 191 test files, with 8 explicit
  skips and no failures.
- TypeScript, ESLint, documentation links/examples/drift guards, README command
  smoke, generated contracts, shared-contract parity, and `git diff --check`
  passed.
- A real isolated workspace exercised Model and Graph generation, bounded
  search, JSON-LD/GraphML/GEXF exports, Evaluation init/status/report, and the
  complete strict Workspace Intelligence runner.

## [0.47.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added the versioned, evidence-backed Workspace Knowledge Graph as an atomic
  derivative of the canonical Workspace Model.
- Added bounded `workspace graph search`, typed entity/evidence/path queries,
  portable graph emission, change/PR overlays, and reproducible retrieval
  payload benchmarks.
- Added versioned contracts for Knowledge Graph, change overlay, bounded search,
  and token-efficiency results.
- Added MCP graph search/evidence/path tools and graph discovery through agent
  context, report indexes, customization packs, runtime command discovery, and
  workspace contract graph output.
- Added a user-focused graph guide, benchmark methodology, AI/IDE/MCP scenario,
  plain-language glossary, and contract catalog discovery guidance.

### Changed

- Made `workspace-knowledge-graph.json` a required Model-stage artifact in the
  unified Workspace Intelligence runner and bound it to the exact model hash.
- Expanded graph facts and proofs across source, packages, APIs, events,
  containers, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI, documentation, ADRs, tests, ownership,
  and service contracts.
- Changed agent guidance to prefer `AGENTS.md` and `INDEX.json`, then bounded
  graph retrieval and proof traversal, before loading complete model/graph
  artifacts.
- Expanded published contract, runtime surface, architecture, artifact producer,
  and documentation drift checks for the new graph surfaces.
- Rewrote optional AI module-recommender documentation to distinguish it from
  deterministic Workspace Intelligence and remove unqualified score, cost, and
  production-readiness claims.
- Bumped the monorepo root, `workspai`, and `wspai` packages to `0.47.0`, and
  aligned the `wspai` dependency on `workspai@0.47.0`.

### Fixed

- Canonicalized Python/Core bridge project metadata from legacy `.rapidkit`
  locations into `.workspai` without overwriting existing canonical files.
- Fixed artifact, contract, command, and documentation gaps for graph consumers
  across CLI, CI, IDE, MCP, and agent surfaces.
- Updated `brace-expansion` to the patched release required by the high-severity
  npm audit advisory.
- Updated `fast-uri` to `3.1.4` to resolve its high-severity host-confusion
  advisory; the final online npm audit reports zero vulnerabilities.
- Removed misleading documentation that treated future package extraction as
  missing product capability; Graph, MCP, shared contracts, and SDK-facing
  surfaces remain available through the current CLI.

### Verification

- Full CLI suite: 2,062 tests passed with 8 explicit skips.
- Workspace Intelligence runtime conformance passed all 11 ordered stages and
  required artifacts.
- Documentation links, examples, drift guard, README command smoke, and live
  CLI command-surface parity passed.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Added the contract-backed `workspace intelligence run` command as the unified
  execution surface for the mandatory Workspace Intelligence lifecycle.
- Added the versioned `workspai-workspace-intelligence-run-v1` report contract,
  runtime registry integration, artifact producer ownership, and semantic
  validation of ordered stage evidence.
- Added transactional workspace lifecycle utilities with rollback coverage for
  create, adopt, import, register, and mirrored project operations.
- Added first-class frontend project execution coverage and hardened generators
  for Node, Go, Java, and .NET project families.

### Changed

- Hardened the canonical intelligence sequence across sync, model, contract
  verify, doctor, analyze, readiness, snapshot, diff, impact, verify, context,
  agent sync, watch, explain, trace, and remediation planning.
- Made the unified runner report each required stage with deterministic status,
  command, timing, artifact, and failure evidence suitable for CI and agents.
- Expanded CLI documentation, command help, runtime contracts, artifact
  catalogs, CI examples, and agent-grounding guidance around the same mandatory
  lifecycle source of truth.
- Hardened Python-engine discovery and workspace metadata propagation while
  preserving Python 3.10 as the minimum supported version and allowing newer
  installed interpreters to be detected.
- Bumped the monorepo root, `workspai`, and `wspai` packages to `0.46.0`, and
  aligned the `wspai` dependency on `workspai@0.46.0`.
- Expanded the release-gated suite to 2,042 passing tests, with targeted
  coverage for Workspace Intelligence runner ordering and evidence, semantic
  contract boundaries, Doctor remediation, workspace lifecycle recovery,
  runtime adapters, archives, platform behavior, and low-coverage utilities.
- Raised the verified CLI coverage to 81.66% statements, 71.27% branches,
  91.95% functions, and 82.38% lines; `workspace-run.ts` now reaches 81.07%
  statements and 82.30% lines.

### Fixed

- Fixed lifecycle partial-write gaps by rolling back newly created metadata,
  registry entries, mirrors, and project files when an operation fails.
- Fixed project metadata path validation and registry/mirror consistency across
  create, adopt, import, archive, and restore workflows.
- Fixed platform capability probes and runtime adapter behavior for Python, Go,
  Java, and .NET environments.
- Fixed documentation and config-example drift, including removal of an
  accidental Python-version pin from the canonical and legacy examples.
- Fixed Windows lifecycle journal writes so GitHub-hosted filesystems may reject
  `fsync` with `EPERM`, `EINVAL`, or `ENOSYS` without discarding an otherwise
  atomic workspace transaction; concurrent journal initialization is now
  recovery-safe.
- Fixed macOS path assertions to compare canonical real paths and corrected the
  Windows-layout Doctor fixture to model `pip --format=json` stdout accurately.
- Fixed the npm dependency tree used by CycloneDX SBOM generation by removing an
  unsafe global `minimatch` override and resolving the Nunjucks/Tsup `chokidar`
  peer versions without invalid packages.
- Hardened metrics collection so test, lint, and audit execution or parse
  failures fail closed instead of being reported as zero errors or
  vulnerabilities; the existing 80% aggregate coverage target remains enforced.
- Fixed metrics collection for the expanded enterprise suite by publishing a
  machine-readable Vitest report during `test:coverage` and consuming that same
  result in `metrics`, eliminating the duplicate full-suite run and fragile
  console-summary parsing. A larger subprocess budget remains for standalone
  metrics compatibility.
- Removed type-only declarations and compatibility-only re-export barrels from
  the executable coverage denominator while retaining TypeScript enforcement
  and explicit public-export contract tests.
- Fixed cross-platform test and runtime drift across Python venv orchestration,
  Windows-layout pip metadata, PowerShell Doctor remediation parsing, Go
  Makefile selection, npm environment-key casing, package-runner path flavor,
  and POSIX-only file-mode assertions.
- Made Python project orchestration dependency-injectable so venv, Poetry, and
  pip fallback tests use deterministic platform-native fixtures without leaking
  host tools or Unix shell scripts into macOS and Windows jobs.

### Verification

- `corepack npm run check`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run contracts:check`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run docs:validate`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run test`
- Unified runner contract, CLI-chain, lifecycle transaction, frontend execution,
  Python-engine state, and package-publish contract suites.
- 2,042 tests passed with 8 explicitly skipped; aggregate coverage passed the
  80% release threshold at 82% in the metrics gate.

## [0.45.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added the versioned `workspai-cli-runtime-command-inventory-v1` contract,
  generated directly from the live Commander tree and published through
  `commands --json`.
- Added command-surface verification that fails on registered/declared drift
  across top-level, scoped, manual workspace, and Core-backed commands.
- Added producer-command ownership to artifact contract descriptors, including
  supplemental governance, recovery, infra, and Workspace Intelligence
  artifacts.
- Added machine-readable command documentation for canonical argv, stdin input
  contracts, output media modes, and process exit semantics.
- Added complete workspace action discovery to `workspace --help`.

### Changed

- Expanded the runtime command surface and published contract catalog with
  command documentation, npm ownership, artifact schemas, and producer links.
- Included the runtime inventory in generated shared contracts and enterprise
  prepack verification.
- Documented the required stdin contract for `workspace feedback record` and
  the raw renderer behavior of graph DOT/Mermaid output.
- Registered `workspace feedback record --json` as a producer of the governed
  Workspace Intelligence history artifact.
- Completed the Workspace Intelligence subcommand classification with contract,
  graph, watch, feedback, and MCP capabilities for downstream consumers.
- Bumped the monorepo root, `workspai`, and `wspai` packages to `0.45.0`, and
  aligned the `wspai` dependency on `workspai@0.45.0`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `pipeline --strict` semantics so warning-only pipelines remain advisory
  by default and become process-blocking only in strict mode; failed stages
  remain blocking in every mode.
- Hardened concurrent dist-test build locking so waiting processes re-check
  freshness only after the active builder releases the lock.
- Kept live command inventory generation deterministic across test and package
  builds.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added Workspace Intelligence architecture and chain contracts to make the
  model → snapshot → diff → impact → verify → context → agent-sync flow
  explicit and runtime-verifiable.
- Added generated contract coverage for runtime command discovery, CLI operation
  results, published contract catalogs, command capabilities, and version
  discovery.
- Added runtime conformance and adversarial validation scripts for Workspace
  Intelligence command/artifact alignment.
- Added archive capability, manifest, and operation result contracts for ZIP64,
  streaming workspace archives, hydrate, inspect, verify, doctor, and failure
  envelopes.
- Added `readiness --workspace <path>` for release-readiness checks outside the
  workspace current working directory.

### Changed

- Bumped the monorepo root, `workspai`, and `wspai` packages to `0.44.0`, and
  aligned the `wspai` dependency on `workspai@0.44.0`.
- Expanded operational JSON schemas for autopilot, doctor, infra, product,
  workspace list/sync/watch/cache, and Workspace Intelligence artifacts.
- Hardened workspace snapshot, archive, contract verify, graph freshness,
  workspace history, explain, MCP, and agent-grounding outputs.
- Updated CLI and docs so Workspace Intelligence evidence flags are documented
  consistently for model, snapshot, diff, impact, verify, graph, and context
  workflows.
- Updated npm release workflow behavior so reruns can tolerate already-published
  versions.

### Fixed

- Fixed `pipeline --no-agent-sync` so it no longer writes agent-grounding
  artifacts when the flag is passed through the CLI.
- Fixed Workspace Intelligence option validation so `workspace impact` and
  `workspace verify` accept `--include-paths`, `--include-evidence`, and
  `--scan-depth <count>`.
- Fixed the artifact catalog mapping for `autopilot-release.v1.json`.
- Fixed release-readiness workspace targeting parity with `analyze --workspace`
  and workspace-level command flows.
- Fixed Windows artifact writes so `EPERM` from filesystem `fsync` does not
  fail workspace init, contract sync, or Workspace Intelligence evidence writes
  after the artifact payload has been written.
- Increased timeout headroom for slower CLI process and HTTP retry integration
  tests under full-suite load.

### Verification

- `corepack npm run check`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run contracts:check`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run check:workspace-intelligence-runtime`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run check:workspace-intelligence-adversarial`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run docs:validate`
- `corepack npm test`
- Real workspace smoke tests across `my-new-wsp`, `my-works`, `my-workspace`,
  and `my-workspoly`.

## [0.43.1] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added `WORKSPAI_DEBUG_ARGS=1` as the Workspai-native debug environment flag
  for CLI argument and bridge diagnostics.
- Added Workspace Intelligence chain validation coverage across minimal and
  polyglot test workspaces, including sync, contract verify, model, context,
  agent sync, graph, diff, impact, verify, trace, explain, run, share, export,
  and feedback history.
- Added E2E workflow coverage for the managed Workspai workspace home at
  `~/.workspai/workspaces`, with legacy RapidKit workspace fallbacks retained.

### Changed

- Kept `RAPIDKIT_NPM_DEBUG_ARGS=1` as a legacy fallback so existing local
  debugging workflows continue to work.
- Aligned the private monorepo, `workspai`, and `wspai` package versions on
  `0.43.1`.
- Updated the `wspai` alias package dependency to require the matching
  `workspai@0.43.1` version.
- Guarded Python dependency sync repair by default so Doctor emits deterministic
  guidance unless explicit dependency-install opt-in is provided.

### Fixed

- Fixed project-scope Doctor fix evidence so project repairs write to the
  project `.workspai/reports` directory instead of overwriting workspace-level
  Doctor fix artifacts.
- Fixed Doctor fix/apply exit-code behavior so unresolved repairs fail
  deterministically, including local-profile flows.
- Fixed Workspace Run diagnostics so Python wrapper failures such as
  `No module named pytest` are classified as setup failures instead of
  `unknown`.

### Verification

- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run typecheck`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run lint`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run format:check`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run build`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run smoke:enterprise-package`
- `corepack npm --workspace wspai run smoke`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run test -- src/__tests__/index.test.ts src/__tests__/package-publish-contract.test.ts`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run test`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run test -- src/__tests__/doctor.test.ts`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run test -- src/__tests__/doctor-canary-matrix.test.ts`
- `corepack npm --workspace workspai run test -- src/__tests__/workspace-run.test.ts`

## [0.43.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Added the `wspai` npm alias package so users can run the canonical Workspai
  CLI through `npx wspai ...`.
- Added monorepo release guards that keep `wspai` and `workspai` versions aligned
  before dry-run and production publishing.

### Changed

- Promoted the Workspai npm package as the canonical CLI surface while keeping
  RapidKit Core as the Python engine bridge.
- Reorganized the npm CLI into the `packages/cli` workspace package for the new
  Workspai monorepo layout.
- Updated publish, smoke, and documentation surfaces for the `workspai` package
  plus the short `wspai` alias package.

### Fixed

- Removed the unavailable `wai` alias path and standardized the short npm alias
  on the available `wspai` package name.

### Verification

- `corepack npm --workspace workspai test -- src/__tests__/package-publish-contract.test.ts`
- `corepack npm run smoke:alias-package`
- `node scripts/enterprise-package-smoke.mjs`
- `corepack npm publish --dry-run --access public --workspace wspai`

## [0.42.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added optional Python engine creation for Python-aware workspaces via
  `create workspace --skip-python-engine`, with explicit skipped-engine metadata
  in workspace manifests, workspace markers, toolchain evidence, and local
  launcher guidance.
- Added shared workspace profile compatibility checks across `create project`,
  `import`, `adopt`, and `bootstrap` compliance so runtime/profile drift is
  reported consistently.
- Added broader runtime detection for profile compatibility decisions, including
  non-native scaffold ecosystems such as Rust, C, and C++.

### Changed

- Decoupled Workspace Intelligence foundation files from the workspace-local
  Python engine. `minimal`, `java-only`, `node-only`, `go-only`, and
  `dotnet-only` workspaces no longer create Python engine artifacts at the
  workspace root.
- Narrowed RapidKit module mutation to the RapidKit-owned module-enabled kits:
  `fastapi.standard`, `fastapi.ddd`, and `nestjs.standard`.
- Preserved adopt/import governance for arbitrary projects while disabling
  module mutation unless project metadata identifies a supported RapidKit kit.
- Updated command reference and CLI help guidance around skipped Python engines,
  profile realignment, and module-enabled kit guarantees.

### Fixed

- Fixed Python-free and skipped-engine workspaces creating misleading
  `pyproject.toml` / `poetry.toml` stubs in the workspace root.
- Fixed skipped-engine launcher messaging so users are directed to npm-owned
  workspace commands and the intentional engine-install path.

### Verification

- `npm exec -- vitest run src/__tests__/e2e.test.ts src/__tests__/create-internal.test.ts src/__tests__/workspace-python-engine-install-gate.test.ts`
- `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm exec -- vitest run`

## [0.41.5] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Documented `create workspace <name> [--here|--output <parent-dir>]` in the
  command reference so custom workspace parents are visible in the CLI contract.

### Fixed

- Fixed `create workspace` duplicate-name checks so an explicitly selected
  target parent (`Current directory`, `--here`, or `--output <parent-dir>`) is
  not blocked by a same-name workspace in the managed home. Creating into an
  already-existing target path is still blocked.
- Fixed `doctor workspace` so an empty workspace shell is not misclassified as a
  project because of root-level toolchain files.
- Fixed default-mode Workspace Verify gate exit codes so `needs-attention`
  passes with exit code `0`, while strict mode continues to fail non-ready
  verification.

### Verification

- `npm exec -- vitest run src/__tests__/workspace-create-location.test.ts`
- `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`
- `npm run build`

## [0.41.4] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added `workspace remediation-plan [--json] [--write] [--ci] [--include-paths]` to build a
  cross-artifact Studio repair plan from blocked governance reports in
  `.rapidkit/reports/`.
- Added `artifact-remediation-plan.v1` (`contracts/artifact-remediation-plan.v1.json`) with
  ordered safe/guarded/invasive actions, file operations, verify commands, rollback
  metadata, and approval state for Bootstrap, Doctor, Analyze, Readiness, Pipeline,
  Workspace Run, and Workspace Verify cards.
- Published the new command on `runtime-command-surface.v1`, extension CLI compatibility,
  agent customization pack, workspace model evidence refs, and agent-sync catalog entries.

### Changed

- Updated operational skills and README guidance so agents read
  `artifact-remediation-plan-last-run.json` before inventing per-card repair logic.
- Documented the artifact catalog entry and commands reference for the remediation-plan
  handoff path.

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run validate:contracts`
- `npm test`
- `npm run smoke:enterprise-package`
- `npm run prepack`

## [0.41.3] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added `doctor-remediation-plan.v1` as the Studio-ready repair contract for
  ordered safe/guarded remediation steps, verification commands, file hints,
  rollback metadata, and policy-aware repair capability state.
- Added `fact-freshness.v1` and fact-level freshness metadata across Workspace
  Intelligence artifacts so agents can distinguish durable facts, derived facts,
  evidence-backed facts, live facts, and facts that require verification before
  use.
- Added multi-stack doctor canary coverage for frontend, backend, and polyglot
  project surfaces.

### Changed

- Deepened `doctor workspace`, `doctor workspace --fix`, `doctor project`, and
  `doctor project --fix` with broader language/framework/runtime probes for
  dependency contracts, environment/config baselines, tests, quality tooling,
  security tooling, containers, deployment surfaces, migrations, health probes,
  and runtime entrypoints.
- Hardened doctor repair planning so Workspai Studio can present the smallest
  safe repair first, preserve guarded steps for review, and verify from the
  correct workspace/project scope.
- Extended Workspace Intelligence model, context, history, verify, and agent
  sync outputs to carry the newer doctor, remediation, and freshness evidence
  without forcing consumers to infer it from display text.
- Hardened CLI routing and enterprise gates around npm-vs-Python RapidKit
  command ownership, package smoke, and manual release workflow validation.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale or misleading doctor/project evidence paths in mixed workspace
  and project scopes.
- Fixed doctor status normalization around warning/error severities so TypeScript
  and downstream JSON consumers agree on status values.
- Fixed repair command safety gaps where Studio-facing consumers needed a
  deterministic repair action instead of shell-chained command text.

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run validate:contracts`
- `npm test`
- `npm run smoke:enterprise-package`
- `npm run prepack`

## [0.41.2] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- Added `workspace why` and `workspace trace` to the published Workspace
  Intelligence subcommand surface in `runtime-command-surface.v1`.
- Added additive `incidentSummary` metadata to
  `studio-blocker-handoff.v1` for Workspai Studio incident flows.
- Added README category positioning for Open-Source Workspace Intelligence and
  a framework-agnostic mental model for created, imported, and adopted projects.

### Changed

- Hardened `enterprise-package-smoke` to use an isolated writable npm cache and
  tolerate npm lifecycle output before `npm pack --json` payloads.
- Updated contract documentation to list current Workspace Intelligence schemas
  and the canonical `.rapidkit/AGENT-GROUNDING.md` artifact path.
- Removed non-null assertions from Workspace Impact centrality/hotspot handling.

### Verification

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run validate:docs`
- `npm run check:generated-contracts`
- `npm run check:shared-contracts`
- `npm test` (1573 passed, 8 skipped)
- `npm run smoke:enterprise-package`
- `npm run prepack`

## [0.41.1] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- Added enterprise npm package smoke and prepack gates:
  `scripts/enterprise-package-smoke.mjs`, `scripts/prepack-enterprise.mjs`,
  `npm run smoke:enterprise-package`, and `prepack` validation before
  `npm pack` / publish.
- Added pipe-safe CLI coverage for `--version --json` so release gates can
  validate machine-readable output through stdout pipes.
- Added a command-safe package-runner invocation contract for npm-family
  subprocesses (`npm`, `npx`, `pnpm`, `yarn`), including `npm_execpath`,
  well-known npm CLI locations, and `corepack npm` fallback.
- Added richer `workspace-dependency-graph.v1` operational profile, topology
  stats, coverage, and diagnostics fields for Workspai graph consumers.

### Changed

- Hardened frontend scaffold execution, Node runtime package-manager detection,
  and workspace fleet init preflight to use the shared package-runner contract
  instead of raw PATH-only `npm` / `npx` lookup.
- Made CLI entrypoint stdout/stderr pipe-safe before fast process exits, fixing
  empty-output behavior in spawned integration commands.
- Updated package metadata/files policy so publish artifacts include enterprise
  smoke/prepack scripts and critical runtime assets.
- Synced FastAPI common environment examples from the core kit source.

### Fixed

- Fixed workspace-root `rapidkit init` failing child Node project init when npm
  was available through npm/corepack resolution but not discoverable by a raw
  `which npm` preflight.
- Fixed nested npx execution inheriting parent `npm_config_package` pins that
  could force inner generators to resolve the wrong package.
- Fixed stale CLI test builds by tracking runner and platform-capability source
  files in the dist build helper.

### Verification

- `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`
- `./node_modules/.bin/vitest run` (1573 passed, 8 skipped)
- `node scripts/enterprise-package-smoke.mjs`
- `node scripts/prepack-enterprise.mjs`

## [0.41.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Added **Phase 4 operational intelligence** CLI surfaces: `workspace explain`,
  `workspace why` (alias), `workspace trace --from <diff>`, `workspace feedback
record`, and read-mostly `workspace mcp serve` (stdio JSON-RPC over workspace
  evidence).
- Added versioned contracts under `contracts/workspace-intelligence/`:
  `workspace-explain.v1`, `workspace-contract-verify.v1`,
  `blocker-resolution.v1`, `doctor-fix-result.v1`, `studio-blocker-handoff.v1`,
  `agent-action-outcome.v1`, `workspace-skills-index.v1`, and
  `workspace-operational-skill.v1`.
- Added operational skills generation via `workspace agent-sync --write`
  (`.rapidkit/skills/*.md`, `workspace-skills-index.json`) — no separate
  `skills generate` command; see `docs/contracts/NAMING_AND_COEXISTENCE.md`.
- Added structured **doctor fix result** output (`fixResult`) for
  `doctor workspace --fix --json` and contract
  `rapidkit-doctor-fix-result-v1`.
- Added `workspace contract verify` evidence artifact and reader alignment for
  IDE/CI consumers.
- Added blocker **resolution hints** on `workspace verify` when steps fail or
  evidence is missing.
- Added `src/contracts/published-contract-versions.ts` and expanded
  `extension-cli-compatibility.v1.json` schema matrix for Workspai extension
  parity.

### Changed

- Extended `workspace verify` plan: per-project **init** and **start** fleet
  evidence when declared in `fleetStages`; optional **doctor-fix** step reads
  `fixResult` from `doctor-last-run.json`.
- Extended `workspace run` enterprise controls: **custom stages** from
  `.rapidkit/context.json` `commands`, **stage dependencies** from framework
  registry, and **`--reuse-passed`** to skip projects already passing in
  `workspace-run-last.json`.
- Refactored framework registry with `resolveFrameworkRegistryEntry()` for
  dependency and stage resolution reuse.
- Updated `docs/contracts/ARTIFACT_CATALOG.md`, `docs/workspace-run.md`, and
  runtime/extension CLI compatibility contracts.

### Notes

- `workspace graph explain <project>` remains the graph-topology slice;
  `workspace explain project:<name>` is the unified narrative surface.
- MCP serve is read-mostly; write/fix tools stay approval-gated per MCP design
  artifact.

### Verification

- `npm run build`
- `npx vitest run` (1550+ tests)
- `npm run validate:contracts`

## [0.40.1] - 2026-06-23

### Changed

- Rewrote root CLI help (`npx rapidkit`, `--help`, `-h`, `help`) to lead with
  **Workspace Intelligence** positioning: lifecycle (Create → Model → Context →
  Impact → Verify), curated command groups, agent grounding, and mental model.
- Kept the full flat command reference, workspace profiles, options, project
  commands, and flag clarifications — no commands removed from help output.
- Updated README **Start here**: split **Install** (global) from **CLI help**
  (`npx rapidkit --help` without implying global install).

### Verification

- `npx vitest run src/__tests__/index.test.ts -t "Version and Help"`

## [0.40.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Added the versioned **Agent Customization Pack** contract
  (`contracts/agent-customization-pack.v1.json`,
  `src/contracts/agent-customization-pack-contract.ts`) with preset/target
  matrices, standard answer contract, drift rules, and output kinds (`hook`,
  `mcp-design`).
- Upgraded `workspace agent-sync` from grounding sync to full pack generation:
  writes `.rapidkit/reports/agent-customization-pack.json` on every successful
  sync.
- Added `--preset minimal|enterprise`, `--target` (including `vscode` alias),
  `--dry-run --json`, and `--strict --json` to `workspace agent-sync`.
- Added enterprise VS Code/Copilot surfaces: workspace/evidence instructions,
  diagnose/repair/release/project-onboard/adopt prompts, the
  `rapidkit-workspace-intelligence` skill (with artifact/command/scope/runtime
  resources + `mcp-tools.md`), and specialized `workspai-*` custom agents.
- Added optional advisory VS Code agent hooks behind `--experimental-hooks`
  (`.vscode/rapidkit-agent-hooks.json`, disabled by default).
- Added read-mostly MCP-ready design artifact
  (`.rapidkit/reports/rapidkit-mcp-design.json`).
- Added `scripts/check-agent-customization-drift.mjs` and
  `npm run check:agent-customization-drift` for CI drift detection on generated
  agent customization files.

### Changed

- Extended `workspace agent-sync` strict validation for required report
  presence/staleness, path containment, pack inventory, answer contract, and
  English-only generated instruction surfaces.
- Updated `docs/examples/ci-agent-grounding.yml`, `docs/ci-workflows.md`,
  `docs/commands-reference.md`, artifact catalog, and README for enterprise pack
  workflows.
- Synced `agent-customization-pack.v1.json` to Workspai contract
  mirrors via shared-contract scripts.

### Notes

- Standard agent answer contract: **Scope → Evidence → Diagnosis → Fix Plan →
  Run → Verify → Assumptions** (with display vs execute command distinction).
- Hooks are advisory and disabled by default; MCP design is read-mostly until
  write tools have explicit approval boundaries.

### Verification

- `npx vitest run src/__tests__/workspace-agent-sync.test.ts`
- `npx vitest run src/__tests__/contracts/`
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run check:shared-contracts`
- `npm run check:agent-customization-drift -- --workspace <workspace-root>` (in
  git worktrees)

## [0.39.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added a first-class, deterministic dependency graph to the workspace model
  (`contracts/workspace-intelligence/workspace-dependency-graph.v1.json`),
  embedded in `workspace-model.v1` with stable hashing.
- Added a multi-source, language-agnostic edge-inference engine: `package-dep`
  edges from `package.json` (JS/TS), `pyproject.toml` path dependencies
  (Python), and `go.mod` replace directives (Go); `contract dependsOn` and
  event publish/subscribe edges from the workspace contract (all runtimes);
  `code-import` edges for JS/TS; and `manual` override edges. Every edge carries
  provenance (`source`/`confidence`/`evidence`).
- Added a shared graph-traversal utility (forward/reverse dependencies,
  transitive closure, blast radius, cycle detection) reused by impact and
  verify.
- Added graph-aware impact: transitive blast radius with `distance`, `path`, and
  `via` per affected project, plus centrality-weighted critical-path hotspots
  (`fanIn`/`fanOut`/`reach`/`betweenness`).
- Added graph-aware verify: the verdict now gates the entire affected subgraph
  (changed projects plus transitive dependents) and surfaces graph integrity
  issues (cycles, dangling edges, orphans).
- Added `rapidkit workspace graph` with `emit`, `explain <project>`, `dot`, and
  `mermaid` subactions for inspecting and visualizing the dependency graph.
- Added a workspace model + graph cache keyed by a structural `inputsHash`
  (`workspace-model-cache.v1`) and `rapidkit workspace model --incremental` for
  graph-aware incremental rebuilds that reuse unchanged project models and
  re-infer only incident edges.
- Added graph-aware transitive freshness with an explicit `fresh | stale |
unknown` verdict in `workspace verify`, chaining each project's content hash
  through its dependencies.
- Added a definitive verify gate (`evaluateWorkspaceVerifyGate`) surfaced as a
  `gate` object in `workspace verify --json`; `--strict` additionally fails on
  `needs-attention` and `stale` freshness.
- Added structured `policyMode` + `policyViolations[]` to `workspace verify`
  output so IDEs and CI can render policy/contract blockers directly.
- Added a bounded health/impact history
  (`.rapidkit/reports/workspace-intelligence-history.json`,
  `workspace-intelligence-history.v1`) with retention.
- Added `rapidkit workspace watch` daemon mode that keeps the model + graph in
  memory and streams `workspace-watch-event.v1` change events
  (`ready`/`changed`/`unchanged`/`error`) via fast incremental rebuilds.
- Added a deterministic large-monorepo performance benchmark
  (`npm run benchmark:intelligence`).

### Changed

- Registered `graph` and `watch` in `WORKSPACE_SUBCOMMANDS` and the generated
  `runtime-command-surface.v1` contract so IDE/CI surfaces detect them from the
  contract.
- Extended the `workspace-impact.v1` and `workspace-verify.v1` schemas additively
  (transitive blast radius, hotspots, affected subgraph, graph integrity,
  freshness, policy violations); existing consumers remain compatible.
- Updated the README, contracts artifact catalog, and Workspace Intelligence
  enterprise roadmap to document the graph-aware engine.

### Notes

- The entire Workspace Intelligence consumer layer (model, graph traversal,
  impact, verify, freshness, centrality, integrity, watch, history, gate, and
  policy) is language- and framework-agnostic and behaves identically for
  created, imported, and adopted projects. Automatic `code-import` edge
  inference is JS/TS-only and degrades gracefully; other runtimes derive
  inter-project edges from manifests, the workspace contract, and manual
  overrides.

### Verification

- `npx vitest run` (full suite: 1517 passed, 11 skipped, 0 failures)
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run check:shared-contracts`
- `npm run test:drift`

## [0.38.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added the Create Planner capability contract at
  `contracts/create-planner-capabilities.v1.json`.
- Added `native-create`, `external-create-adopt`, and `adopt-only` capability
  lanes for scaffold planning.
- Added planned external create-adopt modeling for WordPress, Laravel, Symfony,
  and Rails.
- Added adopt-only runtime modeling for PHP, Ruby, Rust, Elixir, Clojure,
  Scala, and Kotlin.
- Added create planner documentation under `docs/create-planner-capabilities.md`.
- Added generated-contract and parity coverage for the create planner contract.
- Added `createCapability` to workspace model and workspace context project
  summaries.

### Changed

- Extended `contracts/runtime-command-surface.v1.json` with a create planner
  summary so downstream IDE and AI surfaces can consume the same capability
  lanes.
- Updated contract generation and parity sync scripts to include
  `create-planner-capabilities.v1.json`.
- Updated contract documentation and the artifact catalog with the new create
  planner artifact.

### Fixed

- `rapidkit create project` now blocks unsupported native-create attempts before
  delegating to the underlying scaffolder.
- WordPress, Laravel, generic PHP, and other unsupported native-create requests
  no longer fall through to an incorrect RapidKit native kit.

### Verification

- `./node_modules/.bin/vitest run src/__tests__/create-planner-capabilities.test.ts src/__tests__/handle-create-flags.test.ts src/__tests__/contracts/generated-contracts.test.ts src/__tests__/contracts/npm-contracts-parity.test.ts src/__tests__/workspace-model.test.ts src/__tests__/workspace-context.test.ts`

## [0.37.1] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- Updated npm package metadata to align with the Open-Source Workspace Intelligence positioning.
- Published the full `docs/` directory in the npm package so README-linked documentation and image assets are included.
- Replaced the npm README Mermaid diagram with a raw GitHub image URL and moved the Mermaid source into internal documentation.
- Added `workspace verify --json` to workspace agent context safe commands so agents and IDE surfaces can evaluate the official evidence gate.
- Documented freshness rules for `workspace verify` evidence in workspace operations docs.

### Fixed

- `workspace verify` now requires project-scoped `workspace-run-last.json` evidence to match the affected project by project name, relative path, or project path.
- `workspace verify` now blocks stale evidence generated before the current impact report.
- Project evidence from another project can no longer satisfy a required affected-project verification step.
- CLI process integration tests now strip Vitest environment variables from child CLI executions.

### Verification

- `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run src/__tests__/workspace-context.test.ts src/__tests__/workspace-verify.test.ts src/__tests__/workspace-intelligence.test.ts src/__tests__/workspace-intelligence-cli-chain.test.ts src/__tests__/contracts src/__tests__/package-publish-contract.test.ts`

### Fixed

- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in `src/commands/ai.ts`: added type assertion for `selectedModules` from prompt result (type unknown → string[]).
- Fixed unused variable warnings in `src/utils/workspace-registry-summary.ts`: removed unused `registrySummaryPath` and `legacyWorkspaceJsonPath` variables.
- Fixed unused function warning in `src/workspace-run.ts`: removed unused `writeJsonFile` async function.

### Verification

- `npm run quality` passes with zero TypeScript compilation errors.
- Full test suite passes with new coverage for observability, governance, and workspace features.
- Contract schema validation passes for all governance artifacts.
- Integration tests validate workspace registry, agent sync, and evidence collection workflows.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Autopilot release now writes both `.rapidkit/reports/autopilot-release-last-run.json` and alias `.rapidkit/reports/autopilot-release.json` for dashboard and `--output` parity.
- Autopilot reports include `enterpriseControls` and `artifacts.aliasEvidencePath`.
- Workspace run reports include `enterpriseControls.evidencePath` for `.rapidkit/reports/workspace-run-last.json`.
- Workspace manifest records `profile_requested` and `bootstrap_note` when create/bootstrap falls back to a Python-free profile.
- Exported `buildWorkspaceManifest()` for contract-stable workspace metadata generation.
- Mirror sync/verify/rotate JSON reports include `mirror: { configExists, lockExists, artifactsCount }` inventory metadata.

### Changed

- Analyze treats zero-project workspaces as `warn` (not `fail`) for `workspace.projects.missing` across all profiles; verdict stays `needs-attention` instead of `blocked`.
- Analyze `nextActions` for registered empty workspaces prioritize create/import project over create-workspace CTAs.
- Workspace impact softens bootstrap-only git/validation noise to low risk for any profile with zero registered projects.
- `buildWorkspaceImpact` forwards `gitObservation` and skips invalid git path reads when `fromPath` is `git`.
- Readiness env gate uses workspace-scoped Python wording when no projects are registered.
- Workspace run `--strict` exit codes: skipped gates no longer fail the run; enforced `warn`/`fail` gates still block under strict mode.

### Fixed

- Empty workspace `workspace run --strict` with gates disabled returns exit code `0` instead of `1`.
- Workspace intelligence `validation.changed` risk mapping no longer compares against impossible `critical` severity on info/warning-only diffs.

### Verification

- `npm test -- src/__tests__/analyze.test.ts src/__tests__/autopilot-release.test.ts src/__tests__/readiness.test.ts src/__tests__/workspace-intelligence.test.ts src/__tests__/workspace-run.test.ts src/__tests__/workspace-manifest-bootstrap.test.ts src/__tests__/phase3-commands.test.ts`
- `npm run quality`

## [0.35.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added `rapidkit adopt [path]` for in-place project adoption into a workspace without moving or copying source files.
- Added adoption metadata at `.rapidkit/adopt.json` and `.rapidkit/adopt-readiness.json`.
- Added `rapidkit create frontend <id> <name>` with official generators for Next.js, Remix, Vite (React/Vue/Svelte/Solid/Vanilla), Nuxt, Angular, Astro, and SvelteKit.
- Added frontend generator smoke workflow (`smoke:frontend-generators`) and CI coverage for official scaffold commands.
- Added workspace intelligence surfaces: `workspace model`, `workspace context`, `workspace snapshot`, `workspace verify`, `workspace diff`, and `workspace impact`.
- Added workspace intelligence JSON contracts under `contracts/workspace-intelligence/`.
- Added frontend framework detection contracts and doctor frontend signals (Next.js, React, Vite, Vue, Angular, SvelteKit, Nuxt, Astro, Remix, Solid).
- Added stack-aware suggested default names for interactive `create project`.
- Added node lifecycle script resolution, runtime executors, and lifecycle probes for enterprise/polyglot workspaces.
- Added enterprise lifecycle contract helpers and expanded infra stack catalog/contract coverage.
- Added generated shared-contracts pipeline (`generate:contracts`, `validate:contracts`).
- Added Git observation helpers for workspace intelligence snapshots.
- Expanded runtime command surface and import-stack parity snapshots for frontend kits and adoption flows.

### Changed

- Workspace contract and model discovery now include adopted external projects from the workspace registry.
- Node project detection prefers concrete frontend framework signals before falling back to generic Node.
- Doctor project evidence is richer (frontend probes, project kind, lifecycle signals, vulnerability summaries).
- Project command capabilities matrix reflects frontend vs backend module support accurately.
- Import readiness and module-support flows align with adopted/imported project metadata.
- NestJS kit templates use canonical `src/modules/free/` layout and updated Docker/tsconfig paths.
- README and command ownership matrix document adopt, create frontend, and workspace intelligence workflows.

### Fixed

- Runtime acceptance matrix no longer runs global CLI scenarios from the npm repo root (avoids Vite project false positives).
- Workspace acceptance matrix creates workspaces under an isolated run directory with `--output .` and unique names.
- Init-scenario integration tests isolate `HOME` so default workspace slot resolution stays deterministic.
- Hardened analyze/readiness handling for workspace shell roots that are not analyzable projects.

### Security

- Bumped transitive `js-yaml` to address moderate DoS advisory (GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68).

### Verification

- Validated with `npm run validate`, `npm run validate:contracts`, `npm run security`, and `npm run test:runtime-matrix:full`.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Added wrapper-owned `rapidkit pipeline` command to orchestrate sync → doctor → analyze → readiness → autopilot and write `.rapidkit/reports/pipeline-last-run.json`.
- Added `contracts/pipeline-last-run.v1.json` schema for pipeline evidence.
- Added `doctor workspace|project --strict` and `--ci` exit-code gates for CI pipelines.
- Added readiness **analyze** gate consuming `analyze-last-run.json`.
- Added CLI-native verify fallback via inline `workspace contract verify` with evidence at `workspace-contract-verify-last-run.json`.
- Added `--skip-verify` on `readiness` and `pipeline` for environments without extension verify artifacts.
- Added `workspace sync --json` machine-readable output for CI.
- Added shared `findWorkspaceRootUp()` in `src/utils/workspace-root.ts`.
- Added analyze stage to `autopilot release` and `skipPipelineStages` when invoked from pipeline.
- Added regression coverage for doctor gate exit codes, readiness verify/analyze gates, and pipeline ownership.

### Changed

- Bootstrap now auto-syncs workspace registry and contract after successful init.
- `bootstrap --json --compliance-only` skips init for compliance-only CI gates; default `bootstrap --json` runs init after compliance checks.
- Readiness verify gate accepts extension verify-pack artifacts **or** CLI contract verification.
- Updated CLI help, README, and command ownership matrix for the governance loop.

### Fixed

- Doctor JSON/project modes now return CI gate exit codes consistently via `computeDoctorGateExitCode()`.
- Autopilot doctor stage respects `--ci` / `--strict` subprocess exit codes from the npm wrapper.

### Verification

- Validated with `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, and `npm test` (1224 tests).

## [0.33.2] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added cross-platform regression coverage for workspace-local Core runner discovery, marker-based virtualenv paths, user-local/pipx Core installs, and generated launcher recursion guards.
- Added a focused Windows bridge resolver regression step to the native `windows-latest` E2E workflow.

### Changed

- Hardened generated workspace launchers so missing local virtualenvs fall back to a non-local npm wrapper before deterministic user-local Core executables.
- Updated Python Core runner resolution to honor `.rapidkit-workspace` `metadata.python.venvPath` for non-standard workspace-local engine installs.
- Updated user-local Core discovery to scan pipx/Python script locations even when those locations are not on `PATH`.

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows `npx --package rapidkit rapidkit ...` flows being shadowed by a workspace-local `rapidkit.cmd` that could not locate Core.
- Fixed launcher recursion by marking forwarded calls with `RAPIDKIT_LOCAL_LAUNCHER_BYPASS` so the npm wrapper does not delegate back to the same local launcher.
- Fixed an interactive npm-owned generator regression test that could hit git initialization and timeout during coverage runs.

### Verification

- Validated with `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:coverage`.
- Validated focused bridge coverage with platform, launcher, workspace runner, Python bridge, and create fallback regression tests.

## [0.33.1] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added `coreForwarding` bridge helpers with explicit rules for wrapper-shared CLI flags and Python core context engines.
- Added regression coverage for module lifecycle `--dry-run` forwarding and bare workspace name boundaries.

### Fixed

- Fixed npm bridge mis-routing when `--dry-run` prevented core module lifecycle commands (`rollback`, `uninstall`, `upgrade`, `diff`, `checkpoint`) from reaching Python core.
- Fixed bare workspace names such as `my-workspace --dry-run` being forwarded to core instead of staying on the npm wrapper.
- Extended in-project Python core delegation from `pip` only to `poetry`, `venv`, `pipx`, and `python` install backends.

### Changed

- Refactored `shouldForwardToCore()` to recognize core-owned commands before wrapper-shared flag short-circuit.

### Verification

- Validated with `npm run build` and targeted forwarding tests in `coreForwarding.test.ts` and `phase3-commands.test.ts`.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added wrapper-owned `rapidkit infra plan|up|down|status` for contract-driven local infrastructure sidecars (PostgreSQL, Redis, Mailpit, MinIO, and related services) via `.rapidkit/infra/docker-compose.yml`.
- Added `contracts/infra-stack.v1.json` plus discovery from installed modules, project `.env.example`, workspace contract env, and `.rapidkit/infra/overrides.json`.
- Added infra plan artifacts under `.rapidkit/reports/infra-plan.json` and connection env previews under `.rapidkit/infra/.env.example`.
- Added `npx rapidkit workspace foundation ensure` to reconcile workspace.json, policies, toolchain, and related foundation files.
- Added canonical module layout contract (`contracts/module-layout.v1.json`) with doctor workspace module-path audit and `--module-paths` support on `workspace contract verify --strict`.
- Added regression coverage for infra planning/commands, module layout parity, workspace foundation, and CLI help snapshots.

### Changed

- Updated workspace contract discovery to export project scanning helpers used by infra and layout tooling.
- Updated NestJS kit templates to use the canonical `src/modules/free/` module root and aligned TypeScript path mapping.
- Updated CLI help, README, and command ownership matrix to document `infra` and foundation ensure.
- Published `contracts/` in the npm package tarball so bundled contract resolution works outside the repo root.

### Fixed

- Fixed infra contract loading to resolve from the installed package instead of `process.cwd()`.
- Fixed infra compose generation for empty plans and aligned Postgres container env/healthchecks with workspace `.env.example` defaults.
- Improved Docker Compose invocation with compose v2/v1 fallback, normalized `-f` paths, and actionable errors for disk/full-daemon failures.

### Verification

- Validated with `npm run build`, infra unit/command tests, ownership matrix drift guard, and SaaS workspace sidecar smoke (`infra plan`, `infra up`, `infra status --strict`).

## [0.32.2] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added Node-based wrappers for drift guard, local scenario matrix execution, package size reporting, and Husky preparation so release and validation scripts behave consistently across operating systems.
- Added regression coverage for mixed-runtime workspace initialization when an extended runtime is missing from the user's machine.
- Added an offline embeddings artifact validation script for deterministic package preparation.

### Changed

- Hardened Python bridge interpreter selection to prefer explicit overrides, local core virtual environments, versioned Python binaries, and platform defaults before failing.
- Updated release and e2e shell scripts to select only Python interpreters with working `venv` support.
- Updated `workspace run init` to continue initializing remaining projects when a project fails because an optional runtime SDK is unavailable.
- Updated packaging docs to describe validation of the committed embeddings artifact instead of regenerating it during `prepack`.
- Updated generated ASP.NET project launchers so `dev` uses stable `dotnet run` behavior instead of `dotnet watch`.

### Fixed

- Fixed mixed workspaces where a missing `.NET`, Java, or other extended runtime could prevent first-class FastAPI or NestJS projects from initializing.
- Fixed package release flows where Husky output could pollute `npm pack --json` output.
- Fixed release scripts that depended on Unix-only environment assignment or filesystem commands.
- Fixed bridge fallback behavior when `python3` exists but cannot create a virtual environment.
- Fixed generated ASP.NET builds failing on missing XML documentation comments by suppressing `CS1591` while keeping other warnings as errors.

### Verification

- Validated with `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:runtime-matrix`.
- Validated release and docs gates with `npm run validate:docs`, `npm run check:contracts`, `npm run test:parity-contract`, `npm run verify:package-cli`, and `npm pack --ignore-scripts --dry-run --json --silent`.
- Validated local first-use scenarios with `npm run test:scenarios`.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added the shared runtime command surface contract to keep `rapidkit-npm` and the Workspai VS Code extension aligned on lifecycle commands, module mutation support, scaffold kits, and runtime support tiers.
- Added contract regression coverage for runtime command surface parity and module marketplace boundaries.

### Changed

- Updated parity contract sync tooling so import-stack parity and runtime command surface parity are checked together.
- Hardened generated Go/Fiber and Go/Gin Windows launchers to use native Go commands instead of requiring GNU Make.

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows Go project launcher behavior for users without GNU Make installed.
- Fixed a tooling drift gap where npm and extension command surfaces could evolve without a shared tested contract.

### Verification

- Validated with `npm run typecheck`.
- Validated with `npm run lint`.
- Validated runtime command surface coverage with `vitest` contract and Go generator tests.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Added the runtime acceptance matrix script as local release evidence for workspace and project commands across FastAPI, NestJS, Go/Fiber, Go/Gin, Spring Boot, ASP.NET Core, and observed runtimes.
- Added runtime acceptance matrix documentation covering report persistence, release rules, and local-only execution expectations.

### Changed

- Updated runtime acceptance reports to write under a stable system temp report directory by default so evidence survives temporary workspace cleanup.
- Hardened the security workflow so `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` fails the workflow instead of continuing after audit findings.
- Refreshed vulnerable transitive dependency locks, including the Vitest toolchain, to clear npm audit findings before publish.

### Verification

- Validated with `npm run validate`.
- Validated package publishing with `npm publish --dry-run --access public`.
- Validated security posture with `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added portable workspace archive handoff flows for exporting, inspecting, verifying, doctoring, and hydrating workspace archives.
- Added Workspace Contract Registry support for canonical workspace topology, services, ports, dependencies, events, and ownership metadata.
- Added deterministic contract graph and verification utilities so workspace topology can be inspected before sharing or release.
- Added package CLI resolution checks to catch Windows/global install collisions where the Python Core executable could be resolved before the npm wrapper.

### Changed

- Hardened npm-owned command routing so wrapper-level commands stay inside the npm CLI instead of falling through to the Python bridge.

- Hardened command execution classification in `autopilot release` to map process-level crashes to explicit execution-error exit code `3`.

### Fixed

- Expanded autopilot regression coverage with a lightweight end-to-end enforce flow test over a real workspace fixture and warned stage gate behavior.

## [0.27.6] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Added shared workspace project discovery utility to unify scan behavior across `workspace run` and `workspace share`.
- Added centralized timeout policy helpers for probe/network/bridge paths:

## [0.27.4] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added new shared contract parity tests to keep npm import-stack mapping aligned with the shared snapshot contract:
  - `src/__tests__/contracts/import-stack-parity.snapshot.test.ts`
- Added backend framework contract utility and coverage to normalize framework/runtime detection and canonical stack mapping:
  - `src/utils/backend-framework-contract.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/backend-framework-contract.test.ts`
- Added new workspace import command support for bringing local folders or git repositories into a workspace:
  - `rapidkit import <path|git-url> [--workspace <path>] [--name <project-name>] [--git] [--json]`
  - `src/import-project.ts`
  - `src/imported-projects-registry.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/import-project.test.ts`
- Added regression coverage for strict doctor scope semantics:
  - guards against workspace-root misclassification in project mode.
  - guards against invalid workspace marker-only structures in workspace mode.

### Changed

- Hardened parity contract validation with strict schema pinning and bidirectional key-set checks to fail fast on contract drift.
- Updated CI to enforce shared import-stack parity via dedicated parity test gate (`npm run test:parity-contract`).
- Updated doctor/readiness/workspace-share evidence compatibility handling to safely reject unknown schema versions while preserving legacy evidence compatibility.
- Expanded doctor JSON metadata with canonical framework identity for automation:
  - `frameworkKey`
  - `importStack`
- Improved workspace project detection and stage command framework normalization for better runtime/framework command routing consistency.
- Hardened doctor scope resolution boundaries to avoid confusing parent fallback behavior:
  - `doctor project` now resolves only real project scope inside a workspace and no longer treats workspace-root backend markers as project target.
  - `doctor workspace` now enforces stricter workspace-root architecture validation before execution.
- Improved project-scope failure messaging so users get deterministic guidance when running `doctor project` outside a valid project directory.

### Fixed

- Fixed import rollback flow to remove imported files and registry entries when post-import workspace sync fails.
- Fixed explicit workspace import behavior to fail deterministically for invalid workspace paths (no silent fallback).
- Fixed potential path brittleness in parity tests by adding resilient shared snapshot resolution and optional env override support.

## [0.27.3] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added canonical `doctor project` scope support in CLI and docs (`npx rapidkit doctor project`).
- Added project-scoped doctor evidence contract fields and scoring metadata for automation consumers:
  - `contract`
  - `scoreBreakdown`
  - `summary.scopeProvenance`
  - `driftDelta`
- Added deterministic project probes and adapter-contract coverage in doctor tests, including nested-directory project resolution scenarios.
- Added enterprise-grade workspace stage orchestrator implementation and coverage:
  - `src/workspace-run.ts`
  - `src/framework-registry.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/workspace-run.test.ts`

### Changed

- Updated root init semantics so workspace-root aliases share one full-init orchestration flow:
  - `npx rapidkit init`
  - `npx rapidkit workspace init`
  - `npx rapidkit workspace run init`
- Updated workspace command surface to include `workspace run <init|test|build|start>` options for affected-only execution, blast-radius expansion, JSON output, parallel execution, and gate controls.
- Updated docs to be OSS-focused by removing enterprise-only runbook links from open-source README indices.

### Fixed

- Enforced workspace-root-only behavior for workspace management actions (for professional/strict operation semantics).
- Fixed init argument target parsing to ignore flags and resolve only explicit path targets.
- Fixed phase-3 integration timeout flake for workspace-root init wrapper scenario by aligning test timeout with full-init pre-step behavior.
- Removed duplicate enterprise governance runbook from npm OSS docs path (`docs/ENTERPRISE_GOVERNANCE_RUNBOOK.md`).

## [0.27.2] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Enriched `doctor workspace` JSON output with AI/automation profile fields:
  - `runtimeFamily`
  - `projectKind`
  - `supportTier`
  - `frameworkConfidence`
- Expanded framework/runtime detection coverage in `doctor workspace` across Node, Python, Go, Java, PHP, Ruby, and .NET marker sets.

### Changed

- Upgraded Node framework classification from static assumptions to signal-based detection (for example, `Next.js`, `Nuxt`, `NestJS`, `Express`, `Fastify`, `Koa`, `React`, `Vue`, `Angular`, `SvelteKit`).
- Added framework profile rendering in human-readable doctor output (`runtime`, `kind`, `support`, `confidence`).
- Updated doctor workspace project-scan cache signature with schema versioning and broader manifest markers to prevent stale framework classification reuse.
- Updated README command docs to explicitly include `rapidkit readiness` at CLI level and clarify `doctor workspace --fix` advisory behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed frontend misclassification in `doctor workspace` where Next.js projects could be reported as NestJS.
- Fixed advisory warning visibility alignment so environment/security advisory context is represented consistently in doctor summary outputs.
- Removed unrelated extension guidance drift line from `releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.27.1.md`.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Added executable install flow in `rapidkit ai recommend`: when users confirm selected modules, the CLI now runs `rapidkit add module ...` through the core bridge instead of stopping at a placeholder message.
- Added command-scope drift guard coverage between npm ownership contract and implementation:
  - `src/__tests__/contracts/ownership-matrix.test.ts` ensures wrapper-owned command list stays in sync with `docs/contracts/COMMAND_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md`.
- Added AI smoke tests for user-facing reliability:
  - `src/__tests__/commands/ai.command.test.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/ai/embeddings-manager.test.ts`

### Changed

- Updated module catalog parsing to contract-first identity resolution for `ModulesListResponseV1`:
  - Canonical module ID now prefers `slug` before fallback fields (`name`, `id`, `module_id`).
- Improved module search quality by making keyword matching truly case-insensitive.
- Updated coverage policy to include previously excluded high-impact CLI paths (`src/index.ts`, `src/commands/**`, `src/ai/embeddings-manager.ts`) in aggregate coverage accounting.
- Synchronized extension command-scope guidance with npm ownership updates by adding `npx rapidkit readiness` to AI context hints.

### Fixed

- Removed AI recommend UX dead-end where users were prompted to install modules but received a “not implemented” message.
- Resolved contract drift risk where missing `slug` support could generate invalid quick-install targets in mixed registry payloads.
- Aligned embeddings prompt messaging with mock-mode behavior so key/no-key guidance is consistent with runtime behavior.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Fixed Commander action handler binding for `rapidkit workspace share` so options are resolved from command context and no longer misparsed in `npx` flows.
- Restored reliable support for `workspace share` flags:
  - `--output <file>`
  - `--include-paths`
  - `--no-doctor`

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added the new `springboot.standard` generator with Spring Boot project scaffolding, Docker/dev launcher assets, GitHub Actions CI, and generated operational defaults.
- Added a Java runtime adapter for `init`, `dev`, `test`, `build`, `start`, prerequisite checks, and cache warmup flows.
- Added full regression coverage for the Spring generator, Java runtime adapter, and platform capability helpers.

### Changed

- Raised bundle-analysis reliability for this Node CLI by replacing the browser-oriented `analyze` flow with a native `dist/` analyzer that reports raw and gzip sizes for generated bundles.
- Increased project-wide automated coverage to 986 passing tests with stronger Java/Spring and cross-platform branch coverage.

### Fixed

- Hardened Java wrapper execution on Unix by repairing missing executable bits and falling back to `sh` when direct wrapper execution is not possible.
- Enforced Java version preflight checks against `pom.xml` requirements, including nested Java projects discovered from workspace roots.
- Hardened generated Spring CI so wrapper bootstrap is OS-aware and no longer depends on brittle ambient behavior on Windows.
- Closed multiple Windows/pathing gaps through full coverage of `src/utils/platform-capabilities.ts`.

## [0.25.7] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- Extracted shared Go generator helpers into `src/generators/go-kit-common.ts` and rewired both `gofiber.standard` and `gogin.standard` generators to use common template builders for `Makefile`, `rapidkit`, and `rapidkit.cmd`.
- Centralized shared defaults and utilities for Go kit generation (`DEFAULT_GO_VERSION`, `toPascalCase`, `writeGeneratorFile`) to reduce duplicated logic.

### Fixed

- Pinned generated Go tool installation targets for reproducible bootstrap flows:
  - `github.com/air-verse/air@v1.52.3`
  - `github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@v1.16.3`
- Simplified generated `go.mod` templates for both Go kits by removing large indirect dependency blocks and retaining direct requirements.

## [0.25.6] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- 7 new unit tests in `src/__tests__/register-workspace.test.ts` and `src/__tests__/create-internal.test.ts` covering previously uncovered branches in `registerWorkspaceAtPath` and `createDemoWorkspace`: git init failure warn, git commit success path, poetry probe → venv fallback, pipx install path, install throw → `spinner.fail` + rethrow, registry import silent fail, demo workspace git fail warn.

### Fixed

- `import fsExtra from 'fs-extra'` — corrected from `import * as fsExtra` to a proper default import in `src/index.ts`.
- Resolved 10 security vulnerabilities (1 critical `basic-ftp`, 7 high, 2 moderate) in devDependencies via `npm audit fix`.

### Performance

- `dist/index.js` reduced from 258 KB to 126 KB (-51%) by converting five static module imports (`create`, `demo-kit`, `gofiber-standard`, `gogin-standard`, `doctor`) to inline lazy `await import()` calls at their respective call sites.
- Cold-start time reduced from 366 ms to 317 ms on reference hardware.

### Added

- `detectWindowsDoctorWorkspaceShadow()` — detects when a workspace-local `rapidkit.cmd` / `rapidkit.exe` launcher on Windows would shadow the global CLI during `doctor --workspace` runs; prints a yellow warning and falls back to the npm-wrapper doctor workflow to avoid ambiguous binary resolution.

### Fixed

- Formatter whitespace alignment in multi-line string concatenations and ternary expressions (`src/index.ts`)

## [0.25.4] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- ⚡ **Update check caching** — `checkForUpdates()` now caches the npm registry result to `~/.rapidkit/cache/update-check.json` with a 4-hour TTL. Subsequent CLI invocations within the TTL window skip the `npm view rapidkit version` network call entirely, eliminating up to 3 seconds of blocking startup time on slow or offline networks.
- 🔒 Cache is automatically invalidated when the installed CLI version changes (version-keyed), so upgrade notifications are never missed.

## [0.25.3] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- 🩺 Added workspace doctor project-scan cache with signature invalidation and reuse metadata (`.rapidkit/reports/doctor-workspace-cache.json`).
- 🧾 Added doctor evidence export on each workspace run (`.rapidkit/reports/doctor-last-run.json`) with system/project summary and cache context.
- ✅ Added regression coverage for workspace scan caching/evidence generation and Go toolchain-missing auto-fix gating.

### Changed

- ⚡ Parallelized system tool checks in workspace doctor path to reduce runtime for repeat diagnostics.
- 🛠️ Updated `doctor workspace --fix` to run post-fix verification and refresh evidence automatically.
- 📚 Clarified command ownership and doctor scope messaging (`doctor` vs `doctor workspace`) in CLI help and README.

### Fixed

- 🧠 Fixed fix-command parsing for project-scoped commands so `go mod tidy` detection is reliable in auto-fix flow.
- 🐹 Fixed Go auto-fix behavior to skip `go mod tidy` when Go toolchain is unavailable, with explicit guidance instead of failed shell execution.

## [0.25.2] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- 🧭 Added explicit command ownership contract for wrapper/core boundaries:
  - Wrapper-orchestrated project command set now explicitly includes `init`.
  - Added ownership reference doc: `docs/contracts/COMMAND_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md`.
- 🧪 Added forwarding-boundary assertions to prevent `init` delegation regressions.

### Changed

- 🚀 Upgraded `init` orchestration to runtime-aware smart behavior:
  - Detects runtime by project markers and file heuristics (`go.mod`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt`).
  - Keeps `init` on npm wrapper path to apply policy context + fallback logic consistently.
- 🐍 Python `init` now enforces project-local `.venv` binding and falls back to direct `pip` installation paths when primary flow cannot complete.
- 🌐 Node `init` now has resilient package-manager fallback attempts (`npm` → `pnpm` → `yarn`) based on tool availability.
- 🛡️ Lifecycle delegation for Go/Node projects is kept on wrapper/runtime adapter path to avoid local launcher argument drift (`dev --port` misrouting).

### Fixed

- 🧩 Fixed scenario where `rapidkit init` could succeed without creating project-local `.venv` in Python projects due to cached/global Poetry env binding.
- 🧱 Fixed Go lifecycle command forwarding issue that could pass unsupported args to `make` via local launcher delegation.
- 🗣️ Fixed silent `rapidkit init` behavior for Go projects without Go installed by surfacing clear user-facing error messaging.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- 🪟 Added Windows workspace launcher generation (`rapidkit.cmd`) for legacy workspace-local CLI wrappers.
- 🧭 Added cross-platform local-bin path candidates utility for Python tool discovery:
  - `src/utils/platform-capabilities.ts`

### Changed

- 🐍 Updated Poetry-missing behavior in workspace creation to auto-fallback to `venv` without blocking on Poetry installation prompts.
- 🌍 Hardened cross-platform tool/path detection in doctor checks:
  - Poetry detection now probes `python -m poetry` across Python candidates.
  - pipx detection now probes `python -m pipx` when `pipx` binary is unavailable.
  - RapidKit binary discovery now uses centralized platform capability helpers.
- 🧪 Updated internal create-flow tests to reflect Poetry→venv fallback behavior while keeping pipx flow expectations intact.

### Fixed

- ⛔ Fixed blocking UX where selecting Poetry could trigger install-prompt expectations/tests even when fallback-to-venv path should proceed non-interactively.
- 🧹 Removed hardcoded Unix-only Python path assumptions in runtime Python discovery for create flow.
- 🧱 Closed legacy cross-platform gap for workspace-local launcher availability on Windows.

  - `.github/workflows/e2e-smoke.yml`

### Fixed

- 🧩 Reduced test instability caused by absent build artifacts in process-invoked CLI tests.
- 🧹 Reduced noisy workspace/debug output and improved workspace registry hygiene paths.

### Changed

- 🧭 Added npm-level command contract handlers for `bootstrap`, `setup`, and `cache`.
- 🧠 Updated command forwarding boundaries so `bootstrap/setup/cache` stay wrapper-local and are not forwarded to core.
- ⚙️ Extended runtime-aware command dispatch (`init/dev/test/build/start`) with feature-flagged adapter routing (`RAPIDKIT_ENABLE_RUNTIME_ADAPTERS=1`).
- 🗂️ Extracted runtime detection helpers into `src/utils/runtime-detection.ts` for shared project-type detection (`isGoProject`, `isNodeProject`, `isPythonProject`).

### Fixed

## [0.15.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- 🔧 **CLI wrapper flags:** `--create-workspace` and `--no-workspace` are now handled by the npm wrapper for `create project` flows. Wrapper processes workspace creation UX before invoking the Python engine and filters wrapper-only flags so they are not forwarded to the core CLI.
- 🧩 **`registerWorkspaceAtPath()` helper:** Register an existing directory as a RapidKit workspace. Creates `.rapidkit-workspace`, `.gitignore`, workspace launcher (`rapidkit`, `rapidkit.cmd`), `README.md` and installs RapidKit engine (Poetry/venv/pipx).
- 🧪 **Tests:** Unit tests and e2e smoke tests for workspace registration and Scenario C regression tests added to prevent regressions.
- ⚙️ **CI workflow:** `.github/workflows/e2e-smoke.yml` added to run focused e2e smoke and Scenario C regression tests on PRs.

### Changed

- 🐍 **Poetry behavior:** `installWithPoetry()` now configures `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` to ensure in-project `.venv` is created by default (parity with VS Code extension behavior).
- 🧭 **Create UX:** Creating a project outside a workspace prompts the user by default (unless `--yes` or wrapper flags specify otherwise).

### Fixed

- 🛠️ **Scenario C:** Improved Python core detection heuristics in the bridge to avoid bootstrapping a bridge venv when the system Python already has `rapidkit-core` installed. This prevents unnecessary environment changes and confusing UX.

### Documentation

- 📝 Updated README and docs to document new flags and the create-project outside-workspace UX.

### Notes

- This release stabilizes CLI-to-core interactions and UX around workspace creation to align npm wrapper behavior with the VS Code extension.

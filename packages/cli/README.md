## Workspace Intelligence for software systems

> One workspace. One truth. Humans and AI aligned.

Workspai is an open-source CLI that turns one or many software projects into an
organized, evidence-backed view of the whole system. Developers, CI, IDEs,
MCP-compatible tools, and AI agents can use the same current model instead of
rebuilding a different picture from scattered files.

- **See the system:** projects, runtimes, APIs, dependencies, infrastructure,
  documentation, policies, and release state in one model.
- **Ask with proof:** bounded graph answers linked to the files and facts that
  support them.
- **Act with confidence:** change impact, health, verification, readiness, and
  agent context from one defined and versioned intelligence chain.

## Understand Workspai in one minute

Your software system is more than a repository. It may include several
applications and services, shared packages, API contracts, deployment files,
documentation, tests, ownership, and CI evidence. Workspai connects those
surfaces without making AI the source of truth.

| Term                | Plain-language meaning                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Workspace**       | The managed boundary containing registered projects, policy, contracts, and evidence |
| **Project**         | An application, service, library, or existing source tree connected to the workspace |
| **Workspace Model** | The authoritative structured record used to generate the other views and artifacts   |
| **Knowledge Graph** | A queryable representation derived from the model, with typed relations and proofs   |
| **Evidence**        | The source, observation, hash, or report that justifies a fact or decision           |
| **Artifact**        | A durable file under `.workspai/` that another tool can safely consume               |

The Workspace Model is the canonical source of truth. The Knowledge Graph is a
derived, revision-bound representation—not a competing truth and not an
LLM-generated guess.

The deterministic model, graph, contracts, and verification chain do not
require an AI API key. Optional AI-backed features declare that dependency
separately.

## Start in two minutes

### 1. Install or use `npx`

```bash
npm install -g workspai
workspai --help
```

Global installation is optional. Every example below also works with
`npx workspai`. The separate `wspai` package is only a short alias:

```bash
npx wspai --help
```

`workspai` is the canonical npm package and command. `wspai` is an optional
short alias for `npx` workflows. This package is the active CLI boundary in the
[Workspai monorepo](../../README.md).

### 2. Create a lightweight workspace and connect existing source

```bash
npx workspai create workspace platform --profile minimal --yes
npx workspai adopt /absolute/path/to/project \
  --workspace ~/.workspai/workspaces/platform \
  --json
cd ~/.workspai/workspaces/platform
```

`adopt` registers the project without moving or copying it. To create new
software instead, start with `npx workspai create` or read
[Creating Workspaces and Projects](docs/creating-workspaces-and-projects.md).

### 3. Run the complete Workspace Intelligence chain

```bash
npx workspai workspace intelligence run --for-agent codex --strict --json
```

`codex` selects the generated agent-facing surface; use another supported agent
identifier when needed. The underlying intelligence chain and evidence remain
the same.

The run creates durable, discoverable output:

```text
.workspai/
├── workspace.json
├── workspace.contract.json
├── AGENT-GROUNDING.md
└── reports/
    ├── workspace-model.json
    ├── workspace-knowledge-graph.json
    ├── workspace-impact-last-run.json
    ├── workspace-verify-last-run.json
    ├── workspace-context-agent.json
    ├── workspace-intelligence-run-last-run.json
    └── INDEX.json
AGENTS.md
```

Exit code `0` means passed, `1` means execution failed, and `2` means the run
completed but current evidence blocks the requested decision. A blocked result
is useful evidence, not a crashed command.

The broader governance and release pipeline is a separate gate when you are
ready; it is not a substitute for the canonical chain:

```bash
npx workspai pipeline --json --strict
```

## From Code to Shared Understanding

![From Code to Shared Understanding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapidkitlabs/workspai/main/packages/cli/docs/From%20Code%20to%20Shared%20Understanding.png)

| Capability            | What it answers                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**             | What projects, runtimes, frameworks, commands, policies, contracts, and dependencies exist? |
| **Snapshot and diff** | What changed between two known workspace states?                                            |
| **Impact**            | Which projects and transitive dependents are affected?                                      |
| **Evidence**          | What do health, analysis, contracts, and readiness reports prove?                           |
| **Verify**            | Is the affected workspace ready, blocked, stale, or missing evidence?                       |
| **Context**           | What should developers, IDEs, and AI agents know before acting?                             |
| **Explain**           | Why is a project, change, or release blocked, and what should happen next?                  |
| **Sync**              | How do tools stay aligned with the same current workspace truth?                            |

Create, import, and adopt add software to this boundary. Workspace Intelligence
then models and governs every registered project, whether Workspai created it or
it already existed.

Unlike repository-only code intelligence, the workspace boundary can connect
evidence across multiple projects and repositories. A missing relationship
means **not proven by current evidence**, not "these projects are independent."

## One Intelligence Chain

The canonical execution order is versioned in
[`workspace-intelligence-chain.v1.json`](contracts/workspace-intelligence-chain.v1.json):

```text
Model -> Diff -> Impact -> Doctor + Contract Verify + Analyze -> Readiness
      -> Verify -> Context -> Agent Sync -> Explain
```

Each step declares what it consumes, what it produces, and whether its verdict
continues or stops the chain. The CLI, CI, IDE integrations, generated agent
instructions, and documentation can therefore use the same contract instead of
inventing separate workflows.

The execution envelope reports `sync` before Model and baseline resolution
after Model/before Diff as exactly two `preflight` entries. They are not extra
chain stages. The report always contains exactly 11 ordered `stages`; exit `0`
means passed, `1` is a hard execution failure, and `2` is an evidence-blocked
completed run. See [Unified Workspace Intelligence Runner](docs/workspace-intelligence-runner.md)
for the complete report, baseline, failure-propagation, and CI contract.

Use `workspace intelligence run --for-agent <agent> --strict --json` to execute
and enforce this exact contract-backed order. `pipeline --json --strict` remains
the broader governance/release orchestrator (`sync → doctor → analyze → readiness
→ autopilot`); it is not an alias for the canonical intelligence chain.

## Evidence and measurable context

Without bounded retrieval, a developer or agent often has to search and read a
large part of the workspace before answering a local question. Workspai can
return the matching entities, nearby relations, and source proofs first:

```bash
npx workspai workspace graph search "who implements the login API?" --limit 8 --json
```

Use the complete graph for interchange and audits; use bounded search for
normal questions and agent context. Workspai reports unknown or unproven
relationships instead of inventing an edge.

### Current measured fixture

| Measure                              | Observed value |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------: |
| Registered projects                  |             16 |
| Knowledge Graph entities             |          1,738 |
| Knowledge Graph relations            |          2,244 |
| Portable proofs                      |          2,106 |
| Readable proof-source artifacts      |            392 |
| Corpus size (`characters / 4`)       | 134,105 tokens |
| `api endpoint --limit 8` retrieval   |   2,812 tokens |
| Observed retrieval payload reduction |          97.9% |
| Observed corpus/retrieval ratio      |         47.69× |

This is a reproducible observation from one 16-project development workspace on
2026-07-22, not a universal token-cost, answer-quality, or task-success claim.
See [Graph Benchmark Methodology](docs/graph-benchmark-methodology.md) for the
source hash, formulas, limitations, and publication gate. Use
`workspace eval` when measuring provider-reported tokens, latency, cost, and a
verified execution outcome.

## Core Workflows

Use the complete intelligence runner for the normal end-to-end path. The
individual commands below are useful for inspection, automation, and targeted
reruns.

### Model, change, and decisions

| What you need                              | Command                                                                       |

### Graph, agents, and interoperability

| What you need                             | Command                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inspect a project in the dependency graph | `npx workspai workspace graph explain <project> --json`                                  |
| Query proof-backed workspace entities     | `npx workspai workspace graph entities endpoint --json`                                  |
| Retrieve bounded context for an agent     | `npx workspai workspace graph search "authentication endpoint" --limit 12 --json`        |

| Export graph for semantic/visual tools    | `npx workspai workspace graph graphml --output workspace-graph.graphml`                  |
| Trace a relationship and its evidence     | `npx workspai workspace graph path <from> <to> --json`                                   |
| Compare two knowledge-graph revisions     | `npx workspai workspace graph overlay --from <graph.json> --json`                        |
| Generate agent-ready context              | `npx workspai workspace context --for-agent --json --write`                              |
| Generate portable agent and IDE surfaces  | `npx workspai workspace agent-sync --write --refresh-context --preset enterprise --json` |
| Expose current evidence to MCP clients    | `npx workspai workspace mcp serve`                                                       |

### Governance and operations

| What you need                        | Command                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run affected project tests           | `npx workspai workspace run test --affected --blast-radius --json`          |
| Run the release/governance gate      | `npx workspai pipeline --json --strict`                                     |
| Run the canonical intelligence chain | `npx workspai workspace intelligence run --for-agent codex --strict --json` |

`workspace verify` consumes current impact, doctor, contract, analysis, and
readiness evidence. Use `workspace intelligence run` for the canonical chain,
or `pipeline` for the broader governance/release workflow.

Other useful operational commands:

```bash
npx workspai doctor workspace
npx workspai setup <python|node|go|java|dotnet> [--warm-deps]
npx workspai workspace list
npx workspai cache <status|clear|prune|repair>
npx workspai mirror <status|sync|verify|rotate>
```

### Understand a change

Create a baseline:

```bash
npx workspai workspace model --json --write
npx workspai workspace snapshot --json
```

After a change:

```bash
npx workspai workspace model --json --write
npx workspai workspace diff \
  --from .workspai/reports/workspace-model-snapshot.json \
  --json
npx workspai workspace impact \
  --from .workspai/reports/workspace-model-diff-last-run.json \
  --json
```

Impact reports include affected projects and graph paths back to the change, so
developers, CI, IDEs, and agents reason over the same blast radius.

### Ground AI tools

```bash
npx workspai workspace agent-sync \
  --write \
  --refresh-context \
  --preset enterprise \
  --json
```

This generates a versioned Agent Customization Pack from workspace evidence,
including `AGENTS.md`, report indexes, skills, and supported Copilot, Cursor,
Claude, and Codex surfaces. AI tools begin with the same scope, commands,
contracts, blockers, and verification evidence used by humans and CI.

For a user-focused graph quickstart, AI output paths, performance boundaries,
and reproducible token-efficiency methodology, see the
[Workspace Knowledge Graph guide](docs/workspace-knowledge-graph.md) and
[Graph Benchmark Methodology](docs/graph-benchmark-methodology.md).

## Outputs and Consumers

Workspai separates human output, machine output, and durable cross-tool state:

| Output                                    | Primary consumers                                  |

writer, schema, and consumer map.

### Graph interchange formats

The canonical persisted graph is JSON. Explicit projections make the same
governed data usable in documentation, semantic systems, and visualization
tools without changing the source of truth:

| Format  | Typical use                             | Command selector              |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| JSON    | Canonical artifact and programmatic use | `workspace graph emit --json` |
| JSON-LD | Semantic-web and linked-data tools      | `workspace graph jsonld`      |
| Mermaid | Markdown documentation and diagrams     | `workspace graph mermaid`     |
| DOT     | Graphviz rendering                      | `workspace graph dot`         |
| GraphML | General graph analysis tools            | `workspace graph graphml`     |
| GEXF    | Exploration and visualization tools     | `workspace graph gexf`        |

## Onboard Software

All onboarding routes feed the same Workspace Intelligence model.

| Route            | Use it when                                       | Example                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adopt            | Existing source should stay in place              | `npx workspai adopt /path/to/project --json`                                                             |
| Import local     | Existing source should be copied into a workspace | `npx workspai import ../orders-api --workspace /path/to/workspace --json`                                |
| Import Git       | A repository should be cloned into a workspace    | `npx workspai import https://github.com/acme/orders-api.git --git --workspace /path/to/workspace --json` |
| Create workspace | You need a new governed boundary                  | `npx workspai create workspace platform --profile polyglot --yes`                                        |
| Create project   | You need a supported new scaffold                 | `npx workspai create project nextjs web --yes`                                                           |
| Interactive      | You want Workspai to guide the choice             | `npx workspai create`                                                                                    |

Adopt never moves or copies source. Create can use a Workspai-managed kit or an
available official ecosystem generator. Unsupported native create requests are
directed toward official tooling followed by adoption.

- [Creating Workspaces and Projects](docs/creating-workspaces-and-projects.md)
- [Workspace Operations](docs/workspace-operations.md)
- [Create Planner Capabilities](docs/create-planner-capabilities.md)

## Integrations

- **AI tools:** Generate context, `AGENTS.md`, instructions, skills, and tool-specific surfaces with `workspace agent-sync`.
- **CI:** Consume structured reports and exit codes with `pipeline --json --strict`.
- **IDEs:** Read the same model, impact, verification, contract, and context artifacts used by CI.
- **MCP:** Expose read-mostly workspace evidence with `workspace mcp serve`.
- **VS Code:** Use the [Workspai extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rapidkit.rapidkit-vscode) for dashboards, impact, evidence, guided workflows, and Incident Studio.

The VS Code extension invokes this npm CLI, so command-line and visual workflows
share the same contracts and artifacts.

The Marketplace listing may temporarily retain legacy `rapidkit` wording. The
canonical package, command, metadata namespace, and Node.js requirement are the
`workspai`, `.workspai`, and Node.js `>=20.19.0` contracts documented here.

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=20.19.0`
- npm
- Python `>=3.10` only for Python/Core-dependent workflows
- Java, Go, or .NET SDK only when operating those project types

Python is not required for Python-free workspace profiles, npm-owned backend
generators, frontend generators, or workspaces created with
`--skip-python-engine`.

RapidKit Core is the optional Python engine used only by Python/Core-dependent
workflows; it is not a replacement CLI.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                            | What to check                                  | Next step                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Node version is rejected           | `node --version`                               | Install Node.js `>=20.19.0`                                              |
| `npx` resolves an old CLI          | `npx workspai --version`                       | Run `npx workspai@latest --version` or update the global package         |
| Python/Core workflow cannot start  | `python3 --version`                            | Install Python 3.10+ or use a Python-free profile where supported        |
| Workspace is not detected          | Look for `.workspai-workspace`                 | Run from the workspace or pass `--workspace <path>`                      |
| Strict policy blocks a command     | `.workspai/policies.yml`                       | Inspect `workspace policy show` before changing policy                   |
| Reports are stale                  | Report timestamps                              | Re-run `workspace intelligence run` or the documented producing command  |
| AI tools ignore workspace evidence | `AGENTS.md` and `.workspai/reports/INDEX.json` | Run `workspace agent-sync --write --refresh-context`                     |
| Project generator fails            | Runtime and network output                     | Fix the reported prerequisite, then retry or create officially and adopt |

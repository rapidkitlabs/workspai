# Workspace Knowledge Graph

Most code graphs answer questions about one repository. Workspai connects code,
APIs, infrastructure, delivery, documentation, ownership, tests, and runtime
configuration across a whole workspace—and records why every relationship is
believed.

The graph is local-first and deterministic. Building it does not require an
LLM, a hosted service, embeddings, or a graph database.

## Why this is useful

A repository graph can tell you that function A calls function B. A workspace
question is usually wider:

> If we change this endpoint, which project consumes it, which deployment ships
> it, which tests cover it, which document describes it, and which release gate
> can stop it?

Workspai keeps those domains in one proof-carrying representation. The graph is
not the final product screen; it is the shared knowledge layer behind impact,
verification, context, MCP, IDE, CI, and agent workflows.

| If you are…          | The graph helps you…                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A developer          | find the implementation, nearby dependencies, tests, and evidence without repo-wide search |
| A tech lead          | inspect cross-project boundaries, owners, contracts, and change paths                      |
| An AI coding agent   | retrieve question-sized context and verify every returned claim                            |
| A CI/release system  | consume versioned JSON, source hashes, quality diagnostics, and deterministic exits        |
| An IDE or MCP client | offer the same system understanding without rebuilding a private index                     |

## What makes it a workspace graph

Workspai does not stop at files, imports, functions, and classes. Repository
structure is one provider domain alongside APIs, containers, infrastructure,
pipelines, documents, decisions, ownership, tests, environments, and authored
workspace contracts.

That distinction matters when the answer crosses repositories. The canonical
Workspace Model remains the source of truth; the Knowledge Graph is its rich,
queryable, evidence-backed representation. AI is a consumer, never a requirement
for building the graph.

## Try it in two minutes

Run from a Workspai workspace:

```bash
npx workspai workspace model --write --json
npx workspai workspace graph search "authentication endpoint" --limit 12 --json
```

Useful follow-up questions:

```bash
# What APIs and endpoints exist?
npx workspai workspace graph entities endpoint --json

# Why does Workspai believe this entity exists?
npx workspai workspace graph evidence "GET /users" --json

# How are two services, files, or APIs connected?
npx workspai workspace graph path frontend-api "GET /users" --json

# What changed since a saved graph revision?
npx workspai workspace graph overlay --from previous-graph.json --json
```

For agents and MCP clients, prefer bounded search over loading the complete
graph:

```bash
npx workspai workspace graph search "billing database" --limit 12 --json
```

A simplified response looks like this:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "workspace-knowledge-search.v1",
  "query": "billing database",
  "totalMatches": 23,
  "truncated": true,
  "entities": [{ "kind": "database", "label": "billing-db", "proofIds": ["proof:..."] }],
  "relations": [{ "kind": "reads-from", "from": "service:billing", "to": "database:billing-db" }],
  "proofs": [{ "provider": "compose", "artifact": "infra/compose.yml", "trust": "authoritative" }]
}
```

The response is intentionally bounded. `totalMatches` tells the consumer more
results exist, `truncated` prevents silent omission, and every returned claim can
be traced through `proofIds`.

## What it models

The current graph can represent:

- workspaces, projects, services, packages, modules, files, and symbols;
- APIs, endpoints, schemas, events, queues, and databases;
- containers, deployments, environments, pipelines, and infrastructure;
- documentation, architecture decisions, tests, and owners.

Relations include `contains`, `imports`, `depends-on`, `calls`, `exposes`,
`implements`, `reads-from`, `writes-to`, `publishes`, `consumes`, `deploys`,
`documents`, `decided-by`, `tests`, and `owns`.

Every entity and relation carries portable proof references. A proof records its
provider, source artifact, optional pointer/line, content hash, freshness,
derivation, trust, and confidence. Secret values and machine-local absolute
paths are excluded from the portable graph contract.

## Model first, graph second

The canonical direction is one-way:

```text
Workspace sources
      ↓
Canonical Workspace Model + project topology
      ↓
Evidence-backed Workspace Knowledge Graph
      ↓
CLI queries · Context · MCP · Agents · IDEs · CI
```

The graph does not rewrite or replace the canonical Workspace Model. It is a
derived representation bound to an exact model revision by SHA-256. Context and
MCP consumers reject a graph whose source hash no longer matches the model.

The model also contains a smaller project dependency graph. That projection is
used for impact, blast radius, verify, explain, watch, and affected fleet runs.
The richer Knowledge Graph is used for proof-backed retrieval and cross-domain
understanding.

## Sources and providers

The current CLI uses bounded providers for:

- workspace/project foundations and service contracts;
- language-neutral source structure and package manifests;
- OpenAPI, GraphQL, Protobuf, and AsyncAPI interfaces;
- Docker/Compose, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI workflows;
- README/docs, ADRs, tests, and CODEOWNERS.

Providers emit facts and proofs. The graph engine owns stable identity,
deduplication, typed relations, reconciliation, quality metrics, diagnostics,
and deterministic ordering. Regex-backed source observations are explicitly
marked as observed/medium-confidence; authored contracts remain authoritative.

## Outputs and consumers

`workspace model --write` publishes these two artifacts atomically:

```text
.workspai/reports/workspace-model.json
.workspai/reports/workspace-knowledge-graph.json
```

The Knowledge Graph is consumed by:

- `workspace graph search|entities|evidence|path|overlay`;
- `workspace context`, which validates the model hash and publishes graph
  availability and query commands;
- `workspace agent-sync`, which places it in the evidence index and generated
  agent/MCP instructions;
- `workspace mcp serve`, through `getWorkspaceKnowledgeGraph`,
  `searchWorkspaceGraph`, `queryWorkspaceEntities`,
  `getWorkspaceGraphEvidence`, and `findWorkspaceGraphPath`;
- `workspace contract graph`, which exposes the contract projection, project
  topology, rich graph, and quality summary in one response.

The complete graph is an interchange artifact, not a prompt. Agents should
start with `INDEX.json`, use bounded search, then retrieve evidence or a path
for the selected result.

### Interchange and visualization

The JSON artifact is the canonical interchange form of the derived graph; the
Workspace Model remains the system source of truth. Other formats are
deterministic projections of that same graph revision:

```bash
npx workspai workspace graph mermaid
npx workspai workspace graph dot
npx workspai workspace graph jsonld --output workspace-graph.jsonld
npx workspai workspace graph graphml --output workspace-graph.graphml
npx workspai workspace graph gexf --output workspace-graph.gexf
```

- Mermaid and DOT are suited to documentation and architecture diagrams.
- JSON-LD carries semantic identities, relations, and proof references.
- GraphML and GEXF work with graph-analysis and interactive visualization tools.
- The canonical JSON, JSON-LD, GraphML, and GEXF outputs can drive 2D or 3D
  viewers; a 3D view is a presentation layer, not a separate source of truth.

## AI tool output locations

`workspace agent-sync --write --preset enterprise` generates native surfaces
without changing project source:

| Consumer               | Canonical output                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cross-tool/Codex       | `AGENTS.md`, `.workspai/reports/INDEX.json`                                                                                                                        |
| Claude Code            | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/workspai-evidence.md`                                                                                                                  |

| Cursor                 | `.cursor/rules/workspai-grounding.mdc`                                                                                                                             |
| MCP clients            | `.workspai/reports/workspai-mcp-design.json`, `workspace mcp serve`                                                                                                |

Files named `rapidkit-*` are compatibility aliases for older consumers. They
must stay narrowly scoped and must not duplicate an always-applied canonical
rule.

### Avoiding duplicate AI instructions

Canonical Workspai rules are the only always-applied surfaces. Legacy RapidKit
aliases point to the canonical files and apply only to `.rapidkit/**`. This
prevents two equivalent instruction files from being injected into one prompt.

The recommended read order is:

1. `AGENTS.md` for stable workspace policy and navigation;
2. `.workspai/reports/INDEX.json` for artifact discovery and freshness;
3. `workspace graph search` or `searchWorkspaceGraph` for question-sized facts;
4. `workspace graph evidence|path` when a claim needs proof;
5. the complete model or graph only for export, audit, or whole-system analysis.

## Performance and scale

Graph construction inventories each project once per build and caps the number
of scanned files. Providers reuse the same in-memory inventory and content
hashes. Query indexes are cached per immutable graph object; replacing the graph
is the invalidation boundary. `workspace model --cache` and `--incremental`
avoid unnecessary model/project work when inputs are unchanged.

Use full graph export for interchange or offline analysis. Use bounded search
for interactive agents. The latter keeps response size proportional to the
question instead of workspace size.

## Measuring retrieval payload reduction

Workspai does not publish an unqualified “N× fewer tokens” claim. Such a claim
depends on the workspace, query, tokenizer, model, answer-quality target, and
baseline.

Measure the current workspace instead:

```bash
npx workspai workspace graph benchmark "authentication endpoint" --limit 12 --json
```

The report compares the readable, proof-indexed source corpus with the bounded
search payload using a clearly labelled `characters / 4` token estimate. It
reports corpus size, retrieval size, estimated ratio, percentage reduction,
unreadable artifacts, query, limit, graph counts, and the exact source-model
SHA-256 needed to reproduce the run.

This proves **retrieval payload reduction**, not equivalent answer quality,
model-specific billing savings, or universal token savings. A publishable
cross-project claim additionally requires pinned source revisions, fixed
queries, a real tokenizer, repeated runs, and answer-quality evaluation.

In the current 16-project development fixture, the query `api endpoint` with
`--limit 8` returned 8 entities and 9 proofs. The compact retrieval was 2,812
estimated tokens versus 134,105 estimated tokens in 392 readable proof-source
artifacts: an observed 47.69× / 97.9% payload reduction. This is a transparent
fixture result, not a headline claim for every workspace.

See [Graph Benchmark Methodology](./graph-benchmark-methodology.md) for formulas,
reproduction rules, realistic baselines, and the gate required before publishing
a general performance claim.

## Current boundaries

- The CLI graph is intentionally file-backed; a graph database is not required.
- Text search is deterministic lexical retrieval, not embedding similarity.
- Compiler/LSP-grade symbol resolution belongs in deeper language providers.
- Missing project edges mean “relationship not proven,” not “projects are
  independent.” Author service contracts or provide API/package/runtime
  evidence to close that gap.
- The standalone `@workspai/graph` package remains unpublished while its public
  contracts and conformance gates are developed.

## When the graph looks incomplete

Workspai does not invent relationships. If projects appear as disconnected
nodes, check the following in order:

1. run `workspace sync --json` and regenerate the model;
2. declare `dependsOn`, APIs, published events, and consumed events in the
   workspace/project contracts;
3. confirm package manifests, OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/GraphQL/Protobuf documents,
   Compose/Kubernetes/Terraform files, and CI definitions are inside registered
   project paths;
4. inspect `graph.quality`, `providers`, and `diagnostics` before treating a
   missing edge as proof of independence.

An absent edge means “not proven by current evidence,” not “no dependency
exists.”

[Artifact Catalog](./contracts/ARTIFACT_CATALOG.md). For the full command
surface, see [Commands Reference](./commands-reference.md).

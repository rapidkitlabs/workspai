# Unified Workspace Intelligence Runner

`workspace intelligence run` is the canonical contract-backed entrypoint for
refreshing Workspace Intelligence evidence in one deterministic execution. Use
it from a Workspai workspace root:

```bash
npx workspai workspace intelligence run --for-agent codex --strict --json
```

The authoritative result is written atomically to
`.workspai/reports/workspace-intelligence-run-last-run.json` with schema
`workspace-intelligence-run.v1`. JSON stdout returns the same report payload.
Consumers should read the persisted report when they need durable evidence and
use the process exit code for the immediate automation verdict.

## Execution envelope and canonical chain

The runner separates prerequisite operations from the versioned intelligence
chain. `sync` and baseline handling are reported in `preflight`; they are not
additional chain stages.

```text
Execution order

sync
  -> model
  -> baseline resolution
  -> diff
  -> impact
  -> doctor-evidence
  -> contract-evidence
  -> analyze-evidence
  -> readiness-evidence
  -> verify
  -> context
  -> agent-sync
  -> explain
```

The report always contains exactly two ordered `preflight` entries:

| ID         | Execution point              | Successful result     | Purpose                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `sync`     | Before `model`               | `synchronized`        | Reconcile workspace inventory and contract inputs. |
| `baseline` | After `model`, before `diff` | `created` or `reused` | Ensure Diff has an explicit structural baseline.   |

The report always contains exactly these 11 ordered `stages`:

| Order | Stage                | Contract role                                           |
| ----: | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|     1 | `model`              | Build and persist the current workspace model.          |
|     2 | `diff`               | Compare the current model with the selected baseline.   |
|     3 | `impact`             | Calculate affected projects and transitive consequence. |
|     4 | `doctor-evidence`    | Refresh workspace and project health evidence.          |
|     5 | `contract-evidence`  | Verify the workspace contract.                          |
|     6 | `analyze-evidence`   | Refresh structural and operational analysis.            |
|     7 | `readiness-evidence` | Refresh pre-verify release-readiness evidence.          |
|     8 | `verify`             | Produce the definitive evidence-backed gate.            |
|     9 | `context`            | Build agent context from the same current evidence.     |
|    10 | `agent-sync`         | Project canonical context into agent and IDE surfaces.  |
|    11 | `explain`            | Explain the resulting release posture and blockers.     |

The machine-readable authority is
[`workspace-intelligence-chain.v1.json`](../contracts/workspace-intelligence-chain.v1.json).
Commands, websites, IDEs, CI jobs, and agent instructions must not define a
different order or insert `sync` or `snapshot-baseline` into `stages`.

## Baseline semantics

On the first run, the runner creates
`.workspai/reports/workspace-model-snapshot.json` and reports:

```json
{
  "id": "baseline",
  "status": "passed",
  "result": "created"
}
```

On later runs, it reuses the existing snapshot and reports `result: "reused"`.
`baselineCreated` is `true` only when that run created the baseline.

The runner does not silently replace an existing baseline immediately before
Diff. Doing so would erase the change boundary and incorrectly report no
changes. Refresh or replace a baseline only through the explicit
`workspace snapshot` workflow after the intended structural state has been
accepted.

## Status and exit semantics

| Report status | Exit code | Meaning                                                                                        |
| ------------- | --------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `passed`      |       `0` | Every operation executed and no gate blocked the run.                                          |
| `failed`      |       `1` | A required operation threw or could not complete. Downstream stages are recorded as `skipped`. |
| `blocked`     |       `2` | Execution completed, but one or more evidence or verification gates rejected readiness.        |

The canonical mapping is `passed` → `0`, `failed` → `1`, and `blocked` → `2`.

A `blocked` evidence stage does not stop the chain. Context, grounding, and
Explain must still be refreshed so humans and agents receive the current
blocker evidence. A hard `failed` stage stops execution work and every
downstream canonical stage is recorded with `status: "skipped"`, `exitCode: 0`,
and `durationMs: 0`.

Stage invariants:

- `passed` requires `exitCode: 0`;
- `blocked` requires a non-zero stage exit code;
- `failed` requires `exitCode: 1`;
- `skipped` requires `exitCode: 0` and `durationMs: 0`;
- report status and exit code are derived from all preflight and stage results;
- every stage artifact list must exactly match the runtime registry.

`--strict` promotes warning-grade readiness states such as Analyze
`needs-attention` and Readiness `warn` into blocked stage verdicts. It does not
turn evidence blockers into execution failures: the aggregate exit remains `2`,
not `1`.

## Report contract

The durable report contains:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "workspace-intelligence-run.v1",
  "chainSchemaVersion": "workspai-workspace-intelligence-chain-v1",
  "generatedAt": "2026-07-18T00:00:00.000Z",
  "workspacePath": "/absolute/machine-local/path",
  "baselineCreated": false,
  "preflight": [],
  "status": "blocked",
  "exitCode": 2,
  "stages": [],
  "artifactPath": ".workspai/reports/workspace-intelligence-run-last-run.json"
}
```

The abbreviated arrays above illustrate the envelope only; conforming reports
must contain exactly two preflight entries and 11 stages. The complete JSON
Schema is
[`workspace-intelligence-run.v1.json`](../contracts/workspace-intelligence/workspace-intelligence-run.v1.json).
Structural schema validation is necessary but not sufficient. Workspai also
enforces stage order, registered artifacts, baseline coherence, failure
propagation, and aggregate verdict semantics before writing the report.

`workspacePath` and some underlying evidence can contain machine-local absolute
paths. Do not treat the run report as a portable workspace identity contract or
publish it without applying the relevant redaction policy.

## CI consumption

The simplest hard gate is:

```bash
npx workspai workspace intelligence run --for-agent codex --strict --json
```

Both exit `1` and exit `2` fail a normal CI step. If artifacts must be uploaded
after a blocked run, allow the runner step to continue, upload with `if: always()`,
then fail the job from the recorded step outcome. See
[`examples/ci-agent-grounding.yml`](./examples/ci-agent-grounding.yml).

Automation must distinguish:

- exit `1`: repair execution, environment, permissions, corruption, or another
  hard runtime failure;
- exit `2`: inspect Analyze, Readiness, Verify, and Explain evidence and resolve
  the reported blockers;
- exit `0`: consume the newly refreshed artifacts.

Do not parse terminal prose. Read `status`, `exitCode`, `preflight`, `stages`,
and their registered artifacts from the JSON report.

## Relationship to other commands

`workspace intelligence run` is the canonical Workspace Intelligence chain.
`pipeline` is a broader governance/release orchestrator and `autopilot release`
is a separate release surface. Neither command may replace, reorder, extend, or
silently partially execute the canonical intelligence chain.

Individual commands such as `workspace model`, `workspace diff`, and
`workspace verify` remain useful for inspection and targeted renewal. A partial
manual sequence must not be documented or treated as an equivalent replacement
for the unified runner.

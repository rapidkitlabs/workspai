# Workspai Runtime Support Matrix

Last updated: 2026-07-18

This document defines the public support contract for Workspai workspace projects.
It separates three concerns:

- **First-class**: curated kit/framework with scaffold/import/govern/lifecycle support. Core module mutation additionally requires metadata for a module-enabled kit.
- **Extended**: scaffold/import/govern/lifecycle or import/govern workflows are supported, but Core module mutation is disabled unless explicitly added later.
- **Observed**: import/govern/contract visibility is supported; lifecycle commands may require manual project scripts or future adapters.

## Framework Tiers

> **Runtime vs framework:** Python remains a first-class runtime and Node.js is
> extended. Core module mutation is guaranteed only when project metadata names
> a module-enabled kit: `fastapi.standard`, `fastapi.ddd`, or
> `nestjs.standard`. Arbitrary FastAPI, NestJS, Python, Node.js, and frontend
> projects remain governable without gaining module mutation.

| Tier        | Frameworks                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Import Policy

Imported projects are **observed and governed by default**:

- Workspai writes `.workspai/project.json` so workspace contract, graph, doctor, and sharing flows can discover the project.
- Workspai writes canonical project metadata to `.workspai/project.json` and reads legacy `.rapidkit/project.json` as fallback for older projects.
- Workspai writes `.workspai/import.json` and `.workspai/import-readiness.json` for auditability while preserving existing Python Core or legacy `.rapidkit` project state.
- Secrets and dependency/build caches are not copied during local-folder import.
- `module_support` defaults to `false` for imported projects unless existing RapidKit metadata explicitly opts in.

This keeps imports safe for arbitrary repositories while still enabling workspace-level visibility and lifecycle support where adapters exist.

## Executable Acceptance Gate

The runtime support contract is validated by
[RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md](RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md).

Run the default, network-safe gate locally before release:

```bash
npm run test:runtime-matrix
```

Run the full lifecycle gate on a prepared machine with Go, Java, .NET, Python,
and Node installed:

```bash
npm run test:runtime-matrix:full
```

This gate is not wired into regular GitHub Actions yet because it creates real
workspaces and projects across multiple runtimes. Keep it manual/local until a
dedicated scheduled or manually dispatched workflow has runtime caches and cost
controls.

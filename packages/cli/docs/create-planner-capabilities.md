# Create Planner Capabilities

Workspai is a Workspace Intelligence platform, not a blind scaffold wrapper.
The create planner separates project creation into three lanes so developers,
CI, and AI agents share the same expectations.

## Lanes

| Lane       | Status    | Meaning                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `native`   | Available | Workspai owns the scaffold contract, marker, registry, doctor, bootstrap, and workspace model path.                                           |
| `official` | Available | A stable ecosystem generator exists. Available entries run the official generator and register the project; planned entries fall back to adopt. |
| `existing` | Available | The project enters Workspace Intelligence through import/adopt, not native create.                                                            |

## Native create

Native create is reserved for Workspai-owned kits with deterministic contracts:

- FastAPI
- NestJS
- Go Fiber and Go Gin
- Spring Boot
- ASP.NET Core Web API

These kits can be exposed through `workspai create project` because Workspai can
create the project and immediately produce the expected `.workspai` metadata,
workspace registry entries, doctor evidence, and workspace model data.

## Official generators

Some ecosystems have stable official generators. Available entries are invoked
by Workspai and then registered in Workspace Intelligence:

- Next.js: `npx create-next-app@latest <name>`
- React Router: `npx create-react-router@latest <name>`
- React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and Vite: `npm create vite@latest <name> ...`
- Nuxt: `npx create-nuxt@latest <name> ...`
- Angular: `npx @angular/cli@19 new <name>`
- Astro: `npm create astro@4 <name>`
- SvelteKit: `npx sv@latest create <name>`

Other ecosystems are planned official handoffs but are not automated yet:

- WordPress site: `wp core download`, `wp config create`, `wp db create`, `wp core install`
- WordPress block/plugin: `npx @wordpress/create-block@latest <slug>`
- Laravel: `composer create-project laravel/laravel <name>`
- Symfony: `composer create-project symfony/skeleton <name>`
- Rails: `rails new <name>`

These are `official` candidates, not active native kits. Until each planned
post-create contract is implemented end to end, Workspai should guide users to
create externally and then adopt/import the project.

## Adopt only

If a project already exists, or if the requested runtime has no Workspai-owned
create contract, the correct lane is `existing`.

The runtime names in the create planner are detection signals, not an allowlist.
Adopt/import is intentionally open-ended for readable projects that can be
registered and modeled. A project does not need to be PHP, Ruby, Rust, Elixir,
Clojure, Scala, or Kotlin to enter Workspace Intelligence.

Adoption still gives the project Workspace Intelligence:

- framework and runtime detection
- workspace registry membership
- doctor and analyze evidence
- workspace model and context generation
- governance, Advisor, Studio, and agent grounding

## Product rule

Do not convert an unsupported or ambiguous stack request into a different native
kit. For example, a PHP, WordPress, Laravel, Symfony, or Rails request must not
be translated into FastAPI, NestJS, Go, Java, .NET, or a frontend kit.

If executable create is unavailable, the planner should explain the supported
lane and guide the user to `existing` or a future `official` flow.

## CLI guard

`workspai create project <kit> <name>` must check the capability lane before
running any native kit, official generator, or Core engine handoff.

If the request resolves to an available `official` generator, the CLI may run
that ecosystem generator and then register the project in Workspace
Intelligence.

If the request resolves to a planned `official` handoff or an explicit
`existing` runtime signal, the CLI must stop early and explain:

- native create is not available yet for the requested stack
- whether the future lane is `official` or current `existing`
- which external generator commands are relevant, when known
- how to run `npx workspai adopt <project-path>` after the project exists

This keeps AI surfaces, CI, and developer terminals aligned: unsupported stacks
are never silently rewritten into unrelated native kits.

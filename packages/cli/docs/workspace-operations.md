# Workspace Operations

Behavioral guide for import, adoption, snapshots, archives, contracts, collaboration bundles, and local infra sidecars.

Command syntax: [commands-reference.md](./commands-reference.md).

## Import and adoption

Use `import` to copy or clone an existing project into a Workspai workspace.
Use `adopt` when the project must stay where it already lives but should become
visible to Workspai Workspace Intelligence. Core module commands remain limited
to projects whose existing RapidKit metadata identifies a module-enabled kit.

```bash
npx workspai import ../orders-api
npx workspai import https://github.com/acme/orders-api.git --git
npx workspai import ../orders-api --workspace ./my-workspace --name orders-api --json
npx workspai adopt ../marketing-web --workspace ./my-workspace
npx workspai adopt --json
```

### Import behavior

- Local folders are copied; git sources are cloned with shallow history.
- Outside any workspace (no `--workspace`), Workspai creates or reuses the managed `workspai` workspace. New defaults use `~/.workspai/workspaces/workspai`; valid legacy candidates under `~/rapidkit/workspaces/workspai` and `~/Workspai/rapidkits/workspai` can still be reused.
- Existing workspaces under legacy managed roots remain registered after upgrade.
- CLI prints a next-step `cd ...` hint (`suggestedCdCommand` in JSON mode).
- Failed workspace sync rolls back imported files and registry entries.

### Adopt behavior

- Source files are not moved or copied.
- Default workspace resolution matches import, including canonical creation and valid legacy managed-default reuse.
- Writes `.workspai/project.json`, `.workspai/adopt.json`, and `.workspai/adopt-readiness.json`.
- Registry and contract sync include adopted projects for `workspace model`, `workspace context`, Dashboard, and agents.
- `--dry-run --json` previews detection without writing metadata.

### JSON output (`--json`)

- Import returns `workspacePath`, `workspaceResolution`, `defaultWorkspaceCreated`, `suggestedCdCommand`, and `importedProject`. The imported project includes its `source`.
- Adopt returns `workspacePath`, `workspaceResolution`, `defaultWorkspaceCreated`, `wouldCreateDefaultWorkspace`, `dryRun`, and `adoptedProject`.
- Project results include detected `name`, `path`, `stack`, `runtime`, `framework`, `supportTier`, `moduleSupport`, and `confidence` where available.

Imported projects receive `.workspai/import-readiness.json`. Adopted projects add frontend-aware detection for Next.js, React, Vite, Vue, Angular, SvelteKit, Nuxt, Astro, Remix, and Solid.

## Workspace snapshots and safe project operations

```bash
npx workspai snapshot create before-upgrade --reason "before dependency upgrade"
npx workspai snapshot list
npx workspai snapshot inspect before-upgrade
npx workspai snapshot restore before-upgrade --dry-run
npx workspai snapshot restore before-upgrade --force
```

Project delete is safe-by-default:

```bash
npx workspai project archive orders-api --reason "replaced by orders-v2"
npx workspai project archives
npx workspai project restore orders-api
npx workspai project delete orders-api
npx workspai project delete orders-api --permanent --confirm orders-api
```

Lifecycle safety:

- `project delete` archives by default; permanent removal requires `--permanent --confirm <exact-name>`.
- `snapshot restore` requires `--force` unless dry-run.
- Restore, archive, and permanent delete create pre-operation metadata snapshots.
- Archive manifests live under `.workspai/archive/projects`.
- Audit records append to `.workspai/audit/events.jsonl`.
- Workspace policy can require reasons, safety snapshots, or block permanent delete via `.workspai/policies.yml`.

## Workspace collaboration bundle

```bash
npx workspai workspace share
npx workspai workspace share --output ./team-share.json
npx workspai workspace share --include-paths
npx workspai workspace share --no-doctor
```

Bundle includes workspace metadata, discovered projects, report index, and latest doctor evidence (unless `--no-doctor`). `--include-paths` is for internal teams only (absolute paths).

## Workspace contract registry

```bash
npx workspai workspace contract init
npx workspai workspace contract inspect
npx workspai workspace contract verify --strict
npx workspai workspace contract graph
```

Contract file: `.workspai/workspace.contract.json`. Verification checks schema, duplicate slugs, port collisions, and unknown dependencies.

`workspace contract graph --json` preserves its original `nodes`, `edges`, and
summary fields for existing consumers, and now adds an evidence-backed
`dependencyGraph` using the public `workspace-dependency-graph.v1` contract. It
discovers package/workspace dependencies and supported cross-project imports,
records relationship provenance and confidence, and reports graph coverage,
orphans, hotspots, and cycles. Project nodes also expose safe package metadata,
public environment-template keys, command capabilities, key manifests,
entrypoints, API specifications, infrastructure, documentation, and an
operational verification profile. Environment values are never emitted.

The same response also exposes `knowledgeGraph` under the public
`workspace-knowledge-graph.v1` contract. It is a provider-neutral,
proof-carrying view spanning source structure, packages, service and API
contracts, infrastructure, delivery pipelines, docs/ADRs, ownership, tests,
runtime resources, and safe configuration keys. Use the dedicated query and
change-overlay surfaces when the full document is larger than a human needs:

```bash
npx workspai workspace graph entities endpoint --json
npx workspai workspace graph search "authentication endpoint" --limit 12 --json
npx workspai workspace graph benchmark "authentication endpoint" --limit 12 --json
npx workspai workspace graph evidence "GET /users" --json
npx workspai workspace graph path frontend-api "GET /users" --json
npx workspai workspace graph emit --json > .workspai/reports/knowledge-baseline.json
npx workspai workspace graph overlay --from .workspai/reports/knowledge-baseline.json --json
```

The Model step persists the same projection to
`.workspai/reports/workspace-knowledge-graph.json`. It is registered in the
artifact contract registry and agent report index, required by the unified
runner's Model stage, referenced from `workspace-context-agent.json`, and
queryable through the read-mostly MCP server. This keeps CLI, CI, IDE and agent
consumers on one contract revision without injecting the full graph into every
agent prompt.

The overlay follows
`workspace-knowledge-graph-change-overlay.v1`: graph revisions are identified
by content-derived fingerprints (timestamps do not create false changes), and
changed artifacts are portable proof paths rather than machine-local absolute
paths. Proof additions, removals, and content-hash changes are first-class
overlay changes, so a source edit is visible even when the entity and relation
shape remains stable. The builder performs one bounded inventory pass per project and reuses
in-memory content hashes; query indexes live only for the immutable graph
instance, so replacing the graph is the invalidation boundary.

Direction is explicit: legacy `edges` remain producer-to-consumer for backward
compatibility; `dependencyGraph.edges` use consumer-to-dependency semantics so
impact and blast-radius consumers share one canonical interpretation.

Workspai keeps the contract alive during `create project` and `workspace sync` without overwriting manual API/event/owner declarations.

On a freshly cloned or moved workspace, `workspace sync` also repairs the
machine-local global registry entry before discovering projects. The command is
therefore safe to use as the first reconciliation step after clone. For a
legacy workspace, run `workspace foundation ensure` once to add canonical
`.workspai-workspace` and `.workspai/*` foundation files while retaining legacy
metadata as read compatibility input.

## Portable workspace archives

```bash
npx workspai workspace export --output team-workspace.workspai-archive.zip
npx workspai workspace archive inspect team-workspace.workspai-archive.zip
npx workspai workspace archive verify team-workspace.workspai-archive.zip --strict
npx workspai workspace archive doctor team-workspace.workspai-archive.zip
npx workspai workspace hydrate team-workspace.workspai-archive.zip --output ./team-workspace
```

Export excludes dependency folders, build output, git history, logs, `.env`, and private keys by default. Use `--include-env` only for trusted internal handoffs. Hydrate accepts legacy `.rapidkit-workspace` and `.rapidkit/*` archive entries, but restores them as canonical `.workspai-workspace` and `.workspai/*` paths.

Archive export, verification, and hydrate stream file payloads instead of loading the workspace into memory. Exports use ZIP64, so multi-gigabyte workspaces and archives with more than 65,535 files are supported. Stored ZIP entries are the default; use `--archive-compression deflate` when transfer size matters more than export CPU time.

Remote archives are protected by secure defaults: 5 GB maximum download, 20 GB
maximum expanded payload, 200,000 entries, per-entry and compression-ratio
guards, and a five-minute timeout. Public HTTPS destinations are accepted;
loopback, private, link-local, and private redirect destinations are rejected.
Budgets can be lowered or explicitly raised for a controlled workflow:

```bash
npx workspai workspace hydrate https://example.test/team.zip \
  --output ./team-workspace \
  --max-download-size 2gb \
  --max-expanded-size 8gb \
  --download-timeout-ms 120000
```

For a reviewed archive served from a private development network, opt in with
`--allow-private-network`. Never use that flag for user-controlled URLs in CI
or agent services.

IDE, CI, and AI consumers can discover archive behavior from
`contracts/workspace-archive-capabilities.v1.json`. The embedded manifest and every successful
`--json` operation result are runtime-validated against
`contracts/workspace-archive-manifest.v1.json` and
`contracts/workspace-archive-operation-result.v1.json`.

## Workspace infrastructure (sidecar)

Discovery sources: Core module slugs, project `.env.example`, workspace contract env, and `.workspai/infra/overrides.json`.

```bash
cd my-workspace
npx workspai infra plan
npx workspai infra up
npx workspai infra status --strict
npx workspai infra down
```

Artifacts:

- `.workspai/infra/docker-compose.yml`
- `.workspai/reports/infra-plan.json`
- `.workspai/infra/.env.example`

The unified intelligence runner keeps `sync` and baseline resolution in a
separate two-entry execution envelope and emits exactly 11 canonical stages.
Exit `2` means the evidence gate blocked readiness after successful execution;
exit `1` means a hard runtime failure. Read the complete
[Unified Workspace Intelligence Runner contract](./workspace-intelligence-runner.md)
before consuming its report from CI, IDE, or agent integrations.

## Verification evidence freshness

`workspace verify` treats evidence as release-gate material, not just as a file
presence check. Required project evidence must match the affected project in
`workspace-run-last.json`, and evidence generated before the current impact
report is treated as stale and blocking. Re-run the recommended commands from
`workspace impact --json` before using `workspace verify --strict` in CI.

For doctor CI exit codes and JSON evidence fields, see [doctor-command.md](./doctor-command.md).

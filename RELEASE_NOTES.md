## Previous Release: v0.34.0 (June 14, 2026)

### CLI Governance Pipeline and Enterprise Release Gates

This minor release completes the npm-wrapper governance loop so teams can run bootstrap → sync → doctor → analyze → readiness → autopilot entirely from the CLI, without depending on the VS Code extension for verify evidence.

**What's New:**

- 🔗 **`rapidkit pipeline`**
  - One command runs sync, doctor, analyze, readiness, and autopilot audit.
  - Writes `.rapidkit/reports/pipeline-last-run.json` with stage verdicts and exit codes.
  - Flags: `--json`, `--strict`, `--skip-verify`, `--skip-analyze`, `--skip-autopilot`.

- 🩺 **Doctor CI gates**
  - `--strict`: exit `1` on errors or warnings.
  - `--ci`: exit `1` on errors, exit `2` on warnings.

- 🚦 **Readiness improvements**
  - New **analyze** gate reads `analyze-last-run.json`.
  - Verify gate falls back to CLI `workspace contract verify` when extension artifacts are absent.
  - `--skip-verify` for pipelines that verify elsewhere.

- 🚀 **Bootstrap and sync**
  - Post-success bootstrap auto-syncs registry + contract.
  - `--compliance-only` with `--json` for compliance-only CI (skips init).
  - `workspace sync --json` for machine-readable registry sync output.

- 🤖 **Autopilot**
  - Adds analyze stage between doctor and readiness.
  - Uses doctor `--ci` / `--strict` based on mode.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.34.0
```

## Previous Release: v0.33.2 (June 12, 2026)

### Windows Workspace Launcher and Core Resolver Hardening

This patch makes global, `npx`, and workspace-local command flows behave consistently when RapidKit Core is installed inside a workspace, via pipx/user-local locations, or behind a generated workspace launcher.

**What's Fixed:**

- 🪟 **Windows launcher shadowing**
  - Generated `rapidkit.cmd` launchers now forward to a non-local npm wrapper when the workspace virtualenv is missing.
  - Forwarded calls set `RAPIDKIT_LOCAL_LAUNCHER_BYPASS=1` so the npm wrapper cannot recurse back into the same local launcher.

- 🧭 **Workspace-local Core discovery**
  - The npm bridge now detects workspace Core installs from both default `.venv` paths and `.rapidkit-workspace` `metadata.python.venvPath`.
  - Workspace Python version metadata is honored from the marker when available.

- 🐍 **User-local / pipx fallback**
  - The bridge now scans deterministic user-local Core launcher paths even when pipx/Python script directories are not on `PATH`.
  - Generated launchers fall back to user-local Core executables after checking the npm wrapper path.

- ✅ **Regression coverage**
  - Added Windows launcher, POSIX launcher, user-local Core, workspace marker, and multi-OS resolver coverage.
  - The Windows bridge E2E workflow now runs the focused resolver regression suite before native smoke tests.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.33.2
```

## Previous Release: v0.33.1 (June 10, 2026)

### Core Bridge Forwarding Fix for Module Lifecycle and `--dry-run`

This patch fixes npm-to-core command routing so module maintenance and dry-run previews reach Python core reliably, while workspace create/import flows stay on the npm wrapper.

**What's Fixed:**

- 🔁 **Module lifecycle forwarding**
  - `rollback`, `uninstall`, `upgrade`, `diff`, and `checkpoint` now forward to core even when `--dry-run` is present.
  - Prevents silent no-op behavior from the Workspai dashboard and terminal maintenance flows.

- 🧭 **Workspace vs core boundary**
  - Bare workspace names like `my-workspace --dry-run` no longer mis-route to Python core.
  - `create workspace`, `create project`, and npm-owned generator flows remain on the wrapper.

- 🐍 **Python context delegation**
  - In-project delegation now covers `pip`, `poetry`, `venv`, `pipx`, and `python` engines — not `pip` alone.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.33.1
```

## Previous Release: v0.33.0 (June 10, 2026)

### Workspace Infra Sidecar, Module Layout Contract, and Foundation Ensure

This minor release adds contract-driven local dev infrastructure for polyglot workspaces, canonical module layout verification, and a foundation ensure command for workspace governance files.

**What's New:**

- 🐳 **Infra sidecar (`rapidkit infra`)**
  - `plan` discovers Postgres, Redis, Mailpit, MinIO, and related services from modules, `.env.example`, workspace contract env, and overrides.
  - `up|down|status` manage a generated stack at `.rapidkit/infra/docker-compose.yml` without touching the workspace's main compose file.
  - Emits `.rapidkit/reports/infra-plan.json` and connection env previews aligned with project defaults.

- 📐 **Module layout contract**
  - Added `contracts/module-layout.v1.json` and doctor workspace module-path audits.
  - `workspace contract verify --strict --module-paths` checks canonical `src/modules/free/` placement.

- 🧱 **Workspace foundation ensure**
  - `npx rapidkit workspace foundation ensure` reconciles workspace.json, policies, toolchain lock, and foundation artifacts.

- 🪺 **NestJS kit alignment**
  - NestJS standard templates now use the canonical module root and TS path mapping expected by Core modules.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.33.0
```

## Previous Release: v0.32.2 (June 8, 2026)

### Multi-OS Workspace Init and Deterministic Package Release Hardening

This patch closes first-use reliability gaps across Linux, macOS, and Windows. It improves Python bridge selection when the default interpreter is incomplete, keeps mixed-runtime workspace initialization moving when an optional runtime is missing, and makes package/release scripts deterministic without Unix-only shell assumptions.

**What's New:**

- 🧩 **Mixed-runtime workspace init reliability**
  - `workspace run init` now continues across remaining projects when an extended-runtime project, such as `.NET`, cannot initialize because its SDK is missing.
  - FastAPI and NestJS projects in the same workspace are no longer skipped just because another runtime needs setup.
  - Added regression coverage for mixed workspace initialization.

- 🐍 **Python bridge fallback hardening**
  - The bridge now tries explicit Python overrides, local core virtual environments, versioned Python commands, and platform defaults before failing.
  - If one Python command exists but cannot create a virtual environment, RapidKit falls through to the next valid interpreter.
  - Release scripts now probe real `venv` support before selecting Python.

- 📦 **Cross-platform release scripts**
  - Replaced Unix-only npm scripts with Node wrappers for drift guard, scenario matrix execution, and distribution size reporting.
  - `npm pack --json` now remains parseable when Husky is disabled.
  - `prepack` validates the committed embeddings artifact offline instead of depending on `npx` downloads during release.

- 🔷 **ASP.NET scaffold stability**
  - Generated ASP.NET projects now suppress missing XML documentation warnings while keeping other warnings as errors.
  - The generated `dev` launcher now uses stable `dotnet run` behavior across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.32.2
```

## Previous Release: v0.32.1 (June 8, 2026)

### Runtime Command Surface Parity and Windows Go Launcher Hardening

This patch closes a product-surface drift gap between the npm CLI and companion tooling by adding a shared runtime command contract. It also hardens generated Go workspace launchers on Windows so users can run project lifecycle commands without requiring GNU Make.

**What's New:**

- 🧭 **Runtime command surface contract**
  - Added a shared contract for lifecycle commands, module mutation commands, global commands, scaffold kits, runtime tiers, and module marketplace boundaries.
  - Added regression coverage so command-surface drift is caught before release.
  - Extended parity sync tooling to verify both import stack parity and runtime command surface parity.

- 🪟 **Windows Go launcher hardening**
  - Generated Go/Fiber and Go/Gin `rapidkit.cmd` launchers now use native Go commands for dev, build, test, format, and docs flows.
  - Windows users no longer need GNU Make just to run generated Go workspace commands.
  - Added generator coverage to lock this behavior.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.32.1
```

## Previous Release: v0.32.0 (June 7, 2026)

### 🧪 Runtime Acceptance Matrix, Release Evidence, and Audit Hardening

This release strengthens RapidKit npm as the workspace-level verification surface. It adds local runtime acceptance evidence for workspace/project commands, makes release reports survive temporary workspace cleanup, and tightens the security workflow around npm audit findings.

**What's New:**

- 🧪 **Runtime acceptance matrix**
  - Added local acceptance coverage for workspace and project command flows across FastAPI, FastAPI DDD, NestJS, Go/Fiber, Go/Gin, Spring Boot, ASP.NET Core, and observed runtimes.
  - Keeps the expensive matrix out of GitHub Actions by default while preserving it as explicit local release evidence.
  - Documents the release rule for using the matrix before publishing multi-runtime CLI changes.

- 🧾 **Stable release evidence paths**
  - Runtime matrix reports now default to a stable system temp report directory.
  - Reports are no longer removed when the temporary generated workspace is cleaned up.
  - `--report <file>` still supports explicit repository or artifact evidence paths.

- 🔒 **Security and dependency hardening**
  - The security workflow now fails on moderate-or-higher `npm audit` findings.
  - Refreshed vulnerable transitive dependency locks, including the Vitest toolchain.
  - Verified the release with a clean audit and full local validation.

## Previous Release: v0.31.0 (June 2, 2026)

### 🧭 Workspace Contract Registry, Portable Archives, and CLI Ownership Hardening

This release turns the npm CLI into a stronger workspace handoff and governance surface. It adds portable archive flows, a canonical workspace contract registry, and safer command ownership so npm-owned commands stay in the wrapper across global, npx, and Windows resolution scenarios.

**What's New:**

- 🗂️ **Portable workspace archive flow**
  - Added deterministic workspace archive export, inspect, verify, doctor, and hydrate support.
  - Archive hydration is path-contained and hardened against unsafe destination writes.

- 🧩 **Workspace Contract Registry**
  - Added a contract-backed model for workspace services, ports, dependencies, events, and ownership metadata.
  - Added graph and verification utilities for inspecting topology before sharing, packaging, or release.
  - Contract validation now helps catch port conflicts and malformed service metadata earlier.

- 🪟 **CLI ownership and Windows/global install hardening**
  - npm-owned commands now remain in the npm wrapper instead of falling through to the Python Core bridge.
  - Added package resolution checks for install/publish confidence, including Windows `rapidkit.exe` collision scenarios.
  - Strengthened package publish contract coverage for CLI entrypoints and wrapper-owned commands.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.31.0
```

## Previous Release: v0.27.0 (April 27, 2026)

### 🧩 v0.27.0 — Workspace Share CLI Option Parsing Fix (Patch)

This patch fixes `workspace share` option parsing so exported bundles can reliably use explicit output and evidence flags.

**What's New:**

- ✅ **`workspace share --output` now parses correctly**
  - Fixed Commander action-handler binding to ensure command options are read from the proper command context.
  - Prevents `unknown option '--output'` style failures in real-world `npx` usage.

- 🧰 **Workspace share flags are now consistently honored**
  - `--output <file>` writes bundle to the requested path.
  - `--include-paths` includes absolute workspace/project paths when explicitly requested.
  - `--no-doctor` reliably excludes doctor evidence from the exported bundle.

- 🧪 **CLI help/contract alignment maintained**
  - Updated command/help coverage so the workspace share surface stays stable across wrapper entry paths.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.27.0
```

## Previous Release: v0.26.0 (April 24, 2026)

### ☕ v0.26.0 — Spring Boot Generator, Java Runtime Adapter, and Release Hardening (Minor)

This release adds first-class Java/Spring support to RapidKit, including a new Spring Boot generator, a dedicated Java runtime adapter, stronger Windows/workspace preflight behavior, and broader automated coverage across the CLI.

**What's New:**

- ☕ **New `springboot.standard` generator**
  - Generates Spring Boot projects with launcher scripts, Docker assets, CI workflow scaffolding, and production-oriented defaults.
  - Adds generated health/management configuration and Spring-oriented bootstrap assets.

- 🧰 **New Java runtime adapter**
  - Supports `init`, `dev`, `test`, `build`, `start`, prereq checks, and cache preparation.
  - Detects Maven vs Gradle projects and prefers checked-in wrappers when available.

- 🛡️ **Java/Spring hardening**
  - Validates installed Java against project `pom.xml` requirements, including nested Java projects inside workspace roots.
  - Repairs missing wrapper execute bits on Unix and falls back to `sh` when needed.
  - Hardens generated Spring CI so Windows wrapper bootstrap no longer relies on fragile ambient behavior.

- 🧪 **Coverage and validation expansion**
  - Full suite: `986 passed | 11 skipped`.
  - `src/runtime-adapters/java.ts` raised to `85.66%` statements / `86.73%` lines.
  - `src/utils/platform-capabilities.ts` is now fully covered at `100%` across all metrics.

- 📦 **Reliable bundle analysis for this CLI**
  - Replaced the browser-oriented `npm run analyze` flow with a native `dist/` analyzer for Node CLI artifacts.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.26.0

## v0.25.7 (April 19, 2026)

### 🐹 v0.25.7 — Go Generator Template Consolidation (Patch)

This patch refactors the Go kit scaffolding internals to remove duplicated template blocks across `gofiber.standard` and `gogin.standard`, while keeping generated project behavior unchanged.

**What's New:**

- ♻️ **Shared Go generator template module**
  - Added `src/generators/go-kit-common.ts` for common builder logic.
  - Moved shared template construction for `Makefile`, `rapidkit` (shell launcher), and `rapidkit.cmd` (Windows launcher).

- 🧱 **Cleaner Go kit generators**
  - `src/generators/gofiber-standard.ts` and `src/generators/gogin-standard.ts` now focus on kit-specific variables and call shared builders.
  - Reduced code duplication and lowered maintenance cost for future Go kit changes.

- 🔒 **Pinned bootstrap tooling versions**
  - Generated launchers and make targets now use pinned tool installs for reproducibility:
    - `github.com/air-verse/air@v1.52.3`
    - `github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@v1.16.3`

- 🧹 **Simpler generated `go.mod` files**
  - Removed oversized indirect dependency blocks from default templates and kept direct dependency declarations.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.25.7
```

## v0.25.6 (April 19, 2026)

### 🔒⚡ v0.25.6 — Security Patch, Lazy Imports & Coverage (Patch)

Addresses a security advisory in devDependencies, reduces the cold-start bundle size by 51% through lazy imports, fixes an incorrect `fs-extra` import, and expands unit test coverage for error branches in the workspace creation pipeline.

**What's New:**

- 🔒 **0 vulnerabilities** (was 10: 1 critical, 7 high, 2 moderate)
  Resolved via `npm audit fix` on transitive devDependencies (`basic-ftp`, `rollup`, `flatted`, `minimatch`, `picomatch`, `vite`, `serialize-javascript`, `yaml`, `brace-expansion`). No production API changes.

- ⚡ **`dist/index.js` 258 KB → 126 KB (-51%)** via lazy imports
  Five heavy modules (`create`, `demo-kit`, `gofiber-standard`, `gogin-standard`, `doctor`) are now loaded on first use. Lightweight commands like `--version` / `--help` no longer parse all creation/doctor code at startup.

- 🚀 **Startup time 366 ms → 317 ms**

- 🐛 **Fixed `import fsExtra from 'fs-extra'`** — corrected from `import * as fsExtra` to a proper default import, avoiding subtle method-resolution issues at runtime.

- 🧪 **7 new unit tests** covering previously uncovered branches in `registerWorkspaceAtPath` and `createDemoWorkspace` (git init fail/success, poetry venv fallback, pipx install path, install throw, registry import silent fail, demo workspace git fail).

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.25.6
```

---

## v0.25.5 (April 18, 2026)

### 🪟 v0.25.5 — Windows Doctor Shadow Detection (Patch)

Prevents a Windows-specific edge case where a workspace-local `rapidkit.cmd` launcher shadows the global CLI during `rapidkit doctor --workspace`, causing unexpected behaviour.

**What's New:**

- 🪟 **Windows doctor shadow detection**
  When running `doctor --workspace` (or `doctor --scope workspace`) on Windows, the CLI now checks for a local `rapidkit.cmd` / `rapidkit.exe` in the workspace tree.
  If found, it prints a clear yellow warning and routes the doctor workflow through the npm-wrapper path directly — bypassing the ambiguous binary resolution.

- 🧪 **Extended test coverage** for the new detection logic in `phase3-commands.test.ts`

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.25.5
```

---

## v0.25.4 (April 16, 2026)

### ⚡ v0.25.4 — Update Check Caching (Patch)

Eliminates the blocking `npm view rapidkit version` network call on every CLI invocation by caching the result to disk.

**What's New:**

- ⚡ **4-hour disk cache for update checks**
  - Result is stored in `~/.rapidkit/cache/update-check.json`.
  - Subsequent invocations within 4 hours skip the network call entirely.
  - Cache is version-keyed: automatically invalidated when the installed CLI version changes.

- 🔒 **Silent failure guarantee preserved**
  - Cache write failures never block the CLI (same as before).
  - Network errors still fail silently.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.25.4
```

---

## v0.25.3 (March 22, 2026)

### 🩺 v0.25.3 — Doctor Workspace Caching, Evidence, and Safer Auto-Fix (Patch)

This patch upgrades `rapidkit doctor workspace` performance and reliability with project-scan caching, machine-readable evidence output, post-fix verification, and safer Go auto-fix behavior when the Go toolchain is missing.

**What's New:**

- ⚡ **Workspace doctor caching + faster repeat checks**
  - Reuses cached workspace project scans when signatures are unchanged.
  - Emits cache metadata in JSON output for traceability.

- 🧾 **Evidence output for each doctor run**
  - Writes and refreshes run evidence at `.rapidkit/reports/doctor-last-run.json`.
  - Includes health summary, system checks, project findings, and cache context.

- 🧠 **Safer and clearer `doctor workspace --fix` flow**
  - URL-based fixes are recorded as manual guidance (not executed as shell commands).
  - `go mod tidy` fixes are skipped when Go is unavailable, with explicit install-and-rerun hints.
  - Post-fix verification runs automatically and refreshes evidence.

- 📚 **Doctor UX and docs alignment**
  - Clarified `doctor` (system check) vs `doctor workspace` (full workspace health) across CLI messaging and README.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.25.3
```

## Previous Release: v0.25.2 (February 27, 2026)

### 🧠 v0.25.2 — Smart Init Orchestration, Clearer Go UX, and Delegation Boundary Hardening (Patch)

This patch makes `rapidkit init` significantly more resilient across Python/Node/Go projects by enforcing wrapper-owned orchestration with runtime-aware fallbacks, then closes delegation edge-cases that caused noisy/misleading Go command failures.

**What's New:**

- 🧭 **Explicit command ownership matrix for wrapper vs core**
  - `init` is now an explicitly wrapper-orchestrated project command to keep policy + fallback behavior consistent.
  - Added contract doc: `docs/contracts/COMMAND_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md`.

- 🚀 **Smart multi-runtime `init` behavior**
  - Runtime inference improved via project metadata + file heuristics (`go.mod`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`).
  - Python init now enforces project-local `.venv` usage and has pip-based fallback install paths.
  - Node init now attempts package-manager fallbacks when primary install path fails.

- 🛡️ **Delegation boundary hardening**
  - Go/Node lifecycle commands (`dev/start/build/test`) remain on wrapper/runtime adapter path where needed.
  - Prevents misrouting of flags (e.g., `dev --port`) into unintended local-launcher/Makefile paths.

- 🗣️ **Go missing-toolchain UX fix**
  - `rapidkit init` and lifecycle commands now emit clear actionable error messages when Go is missing, instead of silent/noisy failure patterns.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.25.2
```

## Previous Release: v0.25.1 (February 27, 2026)

### 🛠️ v0.25.1 — Poetry Fallback Stabilization, Multi-Platform Doctor Hardening, and Windows Workspace Launcher Coverage (Patch)

This patch release finalizes the new Poetry-missing fallback behavior, hardens cross-platform doctor/tool detection, and closes the remaining legacy Windows workspace launcher gap.

**What's New:**

- 🐍 **Poetry fallback stabilization in create flow**
  - If `installMethod=poetry` is selected but Poetry is unavailable, workspace creation now reliably auto-falls back to `venv` without blocking install prompts.
  - Behavior is applied consistently across interactive create and registration paths.

- 🌍 **Cross-platform detection hardening**
  - `doctor` now checks `python -m poetry` and `python -m pipx` across Python candidates when binaries are missing.
  - Tool path probing now relies on centralized platform-capability helpers rather than fragmented ad-hoc path assumptions.

- 🪟 **Legacy workspace launcher parity on Windows**
  - Workspace creation now emits both `rapidkit` and `rapidkit.cmd` wrappers so local workspace commands have native Windows entry points.

- 🧪 **Test contract alignment**
  - Updated create-internal Poetry tests to match intentional fallback semantics while preserving pipx behavior guarantees.
  - Full test suite remains green after alignment.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
npm install -g rapidkit@0.25.1
```
